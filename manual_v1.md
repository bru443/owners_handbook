## OPERATING MODE

As with a car with automatic transmission, you must get used to not using your left foot to activate the clutch pedal which is not present. While driving, when you lift your foot off the accelerator pedal or when you press the brake pedal during deceleration, the motor generates electric current which is used to brake the car and recharge the high-voltage battery.



### "TURTLE" MODE

If the lamp is lit on the instrument panel display, the state of charge of the high-voltage battery is critical, the engine power gradually decreases and the range is limited. Put the vehicle on charge. If, after the charging the warning lamp remains lit, contact a Jeep Dealership.



### *WARNING*

**1)** *In case of bad weather and flooded roads: Do not drive on a flooded street if the water level exceeds the lower part of the wheel rims.*

**2)** *Due to the quiet operation of your electric car, always set the PRND command to P and engage the electric parking brake and stop the motor before leaving the car. DANGER OF SERIOUS INJURY.*

### HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERY

The high-voltage battery is located at the bottom of the vehicle in a central area and is maintenance-free.

The high-voltage battery is lithium-ion. Lithium-ion batteries provide the following benefits:

are much lighter than other types of chargeable batteries of the same size; keep the charge longer;

have no memory, i.e. it is not necessary to discharge them completely before recharging, as is the case with other types of batteries;

can be recharged and discharged, charging times vary depending on home or public charging mode and power. The high-voltage battery is equipped with conditioning systems that ensure that it operates under the best temperature conditions appropriate to its operation. The traction battery's range varies depending on the type of driving, the route, the use of thermal comfort equipment and the ageing of its components.

NOTE The traction battery ageing depends on several factors, such as climatic conditions and the distance travelled.

### HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERY DISPOSAL

The high-voltage battery is designed to last for the lifetime of the car. If it is necessary to replace the battery, please contact a Jeep Dealership for information on disposal.

NOTE The car is provided with a highvoltage lithium-ion battery. Inappropriate disposal of this type of battery carries a risk of serious burns, electric shock and damage to the environment. In accordance with national and international battery regulations, Stellantis Europe guarantees an adequate collection of this component in cooperation with qualified operators for the proper handling of the batteries to be disposed of.

### GENERAL INFORMATION

The car is also equipped with a battery management system designed to:

ensure safe operation

optimise driving range

optimise the working life of the highvoltage battery

If the temperature of the high-voltage battery is below -10°C, or above 40°C, some car functions may change or turn off as battery performance decreases outside this temperature range.



### *WARNING*

**3)** *The propulsion system of the electric car is connected by the high-voltage battery and when the system is active the components are then powered at highvoltage. Observe the warning messages on the labels on the car when accessing the motor compartment. Any intervention or modification on the high-voltage electrical system of the car (components, cables, connectors, high-voltage battery) is strictly forbidden due to the risks it may imply for your safety. In this case, contact a Jeep Dealership. Tampering with the high-voltage system can lead to serious burns or electrical discharges with even fatal consequences.*

**4)** *Do not resell, give away or modify the high-voltage battery. The high-voltage battery must only be used on the vehicle on which it is supplied. If used outside the vehicle or modified, accidents such as electric shock, heat or smoke generation, explosion or electrolyte leakage may occur. If the vehicle is scrapped without removing the high-voltage battery, contact with high-voltage components, cables and connectors could cause very dangerous electric shock. If the high-voltage battery is not disposed of properly, it may cause electric shock, resulting in serious injury or death.*

**5)** *The mains power supply and the highvoltage battery are potentially dangerous: they can cause injury, burns and risk of electrocution. Always take great care.*

**6)** *Never touch or tamper with the cables and components of the high-voltage battery in any way: do not allow the*

*high-voltage battery components to come into contact with bracelets, necklaces or any metal objects worn.*

**7)** *Do not open, modify or remove the high-voltage battery cover: any gases released may be harmful and flammable: avoid inhaling the gases.*

**8)** *Damage to the vehicle or the highvoltage battery may cause harmful gases to escape, which could cause a fire. In the event of a fire, move away from the vehicle, wear a reflective vest (if required by the regulations in force), position yourself in a safe place, and immediately contact the rescuers, police or fire brigade informing them that this is a vehicle with a high voltage system.*

**9)** *The electrolyte inside the battery is a polluting and flammable material. If the high-voltage battery is not disposed of properly, it may cause fire and pollute the environment.*

**10)** *Live parts of the car are marked with safety warning labels. The high-voltage battery bears a label indicating this danger.*



### *IMPORTANT*

**1)** *The high-voltage battery may only be disconnected by qualified personnel at a Jeep Dealership.*

**2)** *If, as a result of a violent impact or accident, the car has hit the bottom (underbody), have the battery and the high-voltage system checked by qualified technicians.*

**3)** *To preserve the mileage of your vehicle and the durability of your traction battery,* *Jeeps recommends that you; do not fully charge the battery of your electric vehicle daily (charge the traction battery below 80% as often as possible); do not completely discharge the battery; do not store the vehicle for a long period of non-use (more than 12 hours) when the traction battery has a low or high charge level. Prefer a charge level between 20 and 40%; limit the use of fast charging; do not expose the vehicle to temperatures below -30*°*C and above +60*°*C for more than 24 hours; avoid charging the vehicle at negative temperatures (except if the vehicle ran more than 20 minutes) or above +30*°*C; do not use the vehicle's high-voltage battery as a generator of energy; do not use a generator to recharge your vehicle's high-voltage battery.*









*IMPORTANT*

**1)** *Do not dispose of the battery yourself. If the car is scrapped, it must be taken to a Jeep Dealership to have the highvoltage battery removed and disposed of properly by the Jeep Dealership personnel who have the technical skills to operate in complete safety.*

**2)** *Live parts of the car are marked with safety warning labels. The high-voltage battery bears a label indicating this danger.*

**31)** *Do not sit closer than 25 cm to the steering wheel, to permit safe airbag deployment.*

**32)** *Never store any objects under the seats.*

**33)** *After releasing the adjustment lever, always check that the seat is locked on the guides by trying to move it back and forth. If the seat is not locked into place, it may unexpectedly slide and cause the driver to lose control of the car.*

**34)** *Care must be taken when operating the power seats. There is a risk of injury, particularly for children. Objects could become trapped. Keep a close watch on the seats when adjusting them. Vehicle passengers should be informed accordingly.*

**35)** *When folding up, ensure that backrests are securely locked in position before driving. Failure to do so may result in personal injury or damage to the load or vehicle in the event of hard braking or a collision.*

**36)** *If a passenger is present, it won't be possible to use the armrest, but the central backrest needs to be properly attached.*



### *IMPORTANT*

**6)** *The fabric upholstery of the seats has been designed to withstand long-term wear deriving from normal use of the car. Some precautions are however required. Avoid prolonged and/or excessive rubbing against clothing accessories such as metal buckles and Velcro strips which, by applying a high pressure on the fabric in a small area, could cause it to break, thereby damaging the upholstery.* **7)** *Do not arrange objects beneath the electrically adjustable seat and do not impede its movement, since the controls*

*may be damaged. They may also restrict the seat travel.*

**8)** *Before tilting the backrest, remove any objects on the seat cushion.*
