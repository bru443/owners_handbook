## IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ
## REFUELING
Petrol engines : only refuel with unleaded petrol with octane number (RON) not less than 95 in compliance with the European specification EN228. Do not use petrol containing methanol or ethanol E85. Using these mixtures may cause starting and driving issues, as well as damage to fundamental components of the fuel feed system. For further details on the use of the correct fuel see the "Refuelling the car" chapter in the "Starting and driving" section.
## STARTING THE ENGINE
Versions with manual transmission: apply the parking brake; set the gear lever to neutral, fully press the clutch pedal without pressing the accelerator, then turn the ignition device to 1 and release the key as soon as the engine has started. On versions with electronic key, the engine is started by pressing the ignition device button.
Electric versions: with the PRND command in position P, when the ignition device is brought to the position 1 or the START STOP ENGINE button is pushed, an acoustic warning is emitted and the message "READY" appears on the instrument panel display to indicate that the electric traction system of the the vehicle has started. The vehicle is now ready to go.
## PARKING ON FLAMMABLE MATERIAL
When operating, the catalytic converter becomes quite hot. Therefore, do not park your vehicle on grass, dry leaves, pine needles or other flammable materials: risk of fire.
## RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT
The vehicle is equipped with a system that allows continuous monitoring of the components linked to emissions to ensure better respect for the environment.
## ELECTRICAL ACCESSORIES
If, after buying the car, you decide to add electrical accessories (with the risk of gradually draining the conventional battery), contact a Jeep Dealership. They can calculate the overall electrical requirement and check that the car's electric system can support the required load.
## SCHEDULED SERVICING
Correct maintenance helps to preserve the vehicle's performance and safety features, respect for the environment and low operating costs over time.
## "CYBERSECURITY" DEVICES
The car is equipped with security devices developed according to the technological standards currently applied in the automotive industry to protect the onboard electronic systems from hacking attempts. The purpose of these security devices is to minimize the risk of cyber-attacks or the installation of viruses or malware which could compromise the performance of the car and/or allow stealing of personal data of the buyers and/or users and/or unauthorized dissemination of said information.
The car's purchaser must not remove, modify or tamper with these anti-hacking security devices. The Manufacturer will therefore not be liable for negative consequences and/or damage to the vehicle and/or to the buyer and/or to third parties deriving from the removal, modification or alteration of the security devices performed by the car's purchaser and/or user.
## USE OF THE OWNER HANDBOOK
## OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS
Each time an instruction is given that concerns direction (left/right or forward/backward), it is written to be read from the perspective of an occupant in the driver's seat. If a direction is written from a different perspective, it will be specified as such in the text as appropriate.
The figures in the Owner Handbook are provided by way of example only: this might imply that some details of the image do not correspond to the actual arrangement of your car. In addition, the Handbook has been conceived considering vehicles with steering wheel on the left side; it is therefore possible that on vehicles with steering wheel on the right side, the position or construction of some controls is not exactly mirror-like with respect to the figure.
To identify the chapter with the information needed you can consult the index at the end of this Owner Handbook.
The sections can be rapidly identified with dedicated graphic tabs, at the side of each odd page. A few pages further there is a key for getting to know the section order and the relevant symbols in the tabs. There is in any case a textual indication of the current section at the side of each even page.
## WARNINGS AND CAUTIONS
While reading this Owner Handbook you will find a series of WARNINGS to prevent procedures that could damage your car.
There are also CAUTIONS that must be carefully followed to prevent incorrect use of the components of the car, which could cause accidents or injuries.
Therefore, all
WARNINGS and CAUTIONS must always be carefully followed.
WARNINGS and CAUTIONS are recalled in the text with the following symbols:
personal safety;
car safety;
environmental protection.
NOTE These symbols, when necessary, are indicated besides the title or at the end of the line and are followed by a number. That number recalls the corresponding warning at the end of the relevant section.
WARNING If a "conventional battery" is mentioned in the text, this indicates the 12V lead service battery located in the engine compartment. "High-voltage battery" in the text means the high-voltage lithium traction battery of the Full Electric traction system. The term "supplementary battery" instead means a lead battery outside the car used for jump starting.
## SYMBOLS
Some car components have coloured labels whose symbols indicate precautions to be observed when using this component. See below for a brief description of each symbol summarising the contents herein. Always pay attention to all the warnings shown here.

## CHANGES/ALTERATIONS TO THE CAR
## WARNING
Any change or alteration of the car might seriously affect its safety and road grip, thus causing accidents, in which the occupants could even be fatally injured.
## ACCESSORIES PURCHASED BY THE OWNER
If after buying the car, you decide to install electrical accessories that require a permanent electrical supply (e.g. radio, satellite anti-theft system, etc.) or accessories that in any case burden the electrical supply, contact a Jeep Dealership, whose personnel will check whether the electrical system of the car is able to withstand the load required, or whether it needs to be integrated with a more powerful conventional battery.
WARNING Take care when fitting additional spoilers, alloy wheel rims or non-standard wheel hubs: they could reduce the ventilation of the brakes and affect efficiency under sharp, repeated braking or on long descents.
Make sure that nothing obstructs the pedal stroke (mats, etc.).
## INSTALLING ELECTRICAL/ELECTRONIC DEVICES
Electrical and electronic devices installed after buying the car in the context of after-sales service must carry the following label
FCA Italy S.p.A. authorises the installation of transceivers provided that installation is carried out at a specialised centre, in a workmanlike fashion and in compliance with manufacturer's specifications.
WARNING Traffic police may not allow the car on the road if devices have been installed which modify the features of the car. This may also cause invalidation of warranty in relation to faults caused by the change either directly or indirectly related to it.
FCA Italy S.p.A. shall not be liable for damage caused by the installation of accessories either not supplied or recommended by FCA Italy S.p.A. and/or not installed in compliance with the provided instructions.
## RADIO TRANSMITTERS AND MOBILE PHONES
Radio transmitter equipment (car mobile phones, CB radios, amateur radio etc.) cannot be used inside the car unless a separate aerial is mounted on the roof.
Transmission and reception of these devices may be affected by the shielding effect of the car body. As far as the use of EC-approved mobile phones is concerned (GSM, GPRS, UMTS, LTE), follow the usage instructions provided by the mobile phone Manufacturer.
WARNING The use of these devices inside the passenger compartment (without an external aerial) may cause the electrical systems to malfunction. This could compromise the safety of the car in addition to constituting a potential hazard for passengers' health.

## ELECTRIC VERSION OPERATING PRINCIPLE
(where provided)
The propulsion system of the Full Electric Jeep Avenger is completely powered by the energy contained in the high-voltage lithium-ion rechargeable battery of the car. Unlike conventional or hybrid cars, there is no internal combustion engine in this car.
The Jeep Avenger uses the electrical energy stored in the high-voltage battery and not fuel. This battery provides the energy needed to start moving and therefore needs to be recharged before use. If the high-voltage battery is completely flat the car will not start. This car also has a conventional battery (12V) of the same type as those used by cars with internal combustion engines. If the conventional battery is completely flat the car will not start.
The conventional battery supplies power to the conventional electrical system: lights, windscreen wipers, restraint systems (airbags and pretensioners), sound system, etc.
The high-voltage battery supplies power to the electric motor and supplies the high-voltage auxiliary devices (heaters, electric climate compressor, etc.). The electronic converter that powers the 12V system for general car operation is also powered by the high-voltage battery and also recharges the conventional battery.
The battery is charged by connecting the charging socket of the car to the mains power supply using the charging cable. The high-voltage battery is also partially recharged while driving during deceleration or braking. During this steps, the battery is recharged by regeneration via the electric motor. This is an efficient way of recharging as the kinetic energy of the car is used and converted into electric charging energy. Electric cars have specific characteristics of use, which is useful to know, in order to achieve optimal performance.

## OPERATING MODE
As with a car with automatic transmission, you must get used to not using your left foot to activate the clutch pedal which is not present. While driving, when you lift your foot off the accelerator pedal or when you press the brake pedal during deceleration, the motor generates electric current which is used to brake the car and recharge the high-voltage battery.
1) 2)
## "TURTLE" MODE
If the lamp is lit on the instrument panel display, the state of charge of the high-voltage battery is critical, the engine power gradually decreases and the range is limited. Put the vehicle on charge. If, after the charging the warning lamp remains lit, contact a Jeep Dealership.
## WARNING
- 1) In case of bad weather and flooded roads: Do not drive on a flooded street if the water level exceeds the lower part of the wheel rims.
- 2) Due to the quiet operation of your electric car, always set the PRND command to P and engage the electric parking brake and stop the motor before leaving the car. DANGER OF SERIOUS INJURY.
## HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERY
The high-voltage battery is located at the bottom of the vehicle in a central area and is maintenance-free.
The high-voltage battery is lithium-ion. Lithium-ion batteries provide the following benefits:
are much lighter than other types of chargeable batteries of the same size; keep the charge longer;
- have no memory, i.e. it is not necessary to discharge them completely before recharging, as is the case with other types of batteries;
can be recharged and discharged, charging times vary depending on home or public charging mode and power. The high-voltage battery is equipped with conditioning systems that ensure that it operates under the best temperature conditions appropriate to its operation. The traction battery's range varies depending on the type of driving, the route, the use of thermal comfort equipment and the ageing of its components.
NOTE The traction battery ageing depends on several factors, such as climatic conditions and the distance travelled.

## HIGH-VOLTAGE BATTERY DISPOSAL
The high-voltage battery is designed to last for the lifetime of the car. If it is necessary to replace the battery, please contact a Jeep Dealership for information on disposal.
NOTE The car is provided with a highvoltage lithium-ion battery. Inappropriate disposal of this type of battery carries a risk of serious burns, electric shock and damage to the environment. In accordance with national and international battery regulations, Stellantis Europe guarantees an adequate collection of this component in cooperation with qualified operators for the proper handling of the batteries to be disposed of.
## GENERAL INFORMATION
The car is also equipped with a battery management system designed to:
ensure safe operation
optimise driving range
optimise the working life of the highvoltage battery
If the temperature of the high-voltage battery is below -10 ° C, or above 40 ° C, some car functions may change or turn off as battery performance decreases outside this temperature range.
## WARNING
- 3) The propulsion system of the electric car is connected by the high-voltage battery and when the system is active the components are then powered at highvoltage. Observe the warning messages on the labels on the car when accessing the motor compartment. Any intervention or modification on the high-voltage electrical system of the car (components, cables, connectors, high-voltage battery) is strictly forbidden due to the risks it may imply for your safety. In this case, contact a Jeep Dealership. Tampering with the high-voltage system can lead to serious burns or electrical discharges with even fatal consequences.
- 4) Do not resell, give away or modify the high-voltage battery. The high-voltage battery must only be used on the vehicle on which it is supplied. If used outside the vehicle or modified, accidents such as electric shock, heat or smoke generation, explosion or electrolyte leakage may occur. If the vehicle is scrapped without removing the high-voltage battery, contact with high-voltage components, cables and connectors could cause very dangerous electric shock. If the high-voltage battery is not disposed of properly, it may cause electric shock, resulting in serious injury or death.
- 5) The mains power supply and the highvoltage battery are potentially dangerous: they can cause injury, burns and risk of electrocution. Always take great care.
- 6) Never touch or tamper with the cables and components of the high-voltage battery in any way: do not allow the
high-voltage battery components to come into contact with bracelets, necklaces or any metal objects worn.
- 7) Do not open, modify or remove the high-voltage battery cover: any gases released may be harmful and flammable: avoid inhaling the gases.
- 8) Damage to the vehicle or the highvoltage battery may cause harmful gases to escape, which could cause a fire. In the event of a fire, move away from the vehicle, wear a reflective vest (if required by the regulations in force), position yourself in a safe place, and immediately contact the rescuers, police or fire brigade informing them that this is a vehicle with a high voltage system.
- 9) The electrolyte inside the battery is a polluting and flammable material. If the high-voltage battery is not disposed of properly, it may cause fire and pollute the environment.
- 10) Live parts of the car are marked with safety warning labels. The high-voltage battery bears a label indicating this danger.
## IMPORTANT
- 1) The high-voltage battery may only be disconnected by qualified personnel at a Jeep Dealership.
- 2) If, as a result of a violent impact or accident, the car has hit the bottom (underbody), have the battery and the high-voltage system checked by qualified technicians.
- 3) To preserve the mileage of your vehicle and the durability of your traction battery,
Jeeps recommends that you; do not fully charge the battery of your electric vehicle daily (charge the traction battery below 80% as often as possible); do not completely discharge the battery; do not store the vehicle for a long period of non-use (more than 12 hours) when the traction battery has a low or high charge level. Prefer a charge level between 20 and 40%; limit the use of fast charging; do not expose the vehicle to temperatures below -30 ° C and above +60 ° C for more than 24 hours; avoid charging the vehicle at negative temperatures (except if the vehicle ran more than 20 minutes) or above +30 ° C; do not use the vehicle's high-voltage battery as a generator of energy; do not use a generator to recharge your vehicle's high-voltage battery.
## IMPORTANT
- 1) Do not dispose of the battery yourself. If the car is scrapped, it must be taken to a Jeep Dealership to have the highvoltage battery removed and disposed of properly by the Jeep Dealership personnel who have the technical skills to operate in complete safety.
- 2) Live parts of the car are marked with safety warning labels. The high-voltage battery bears a label indicating this danger.

- To switch off the parking lamps, return the lighting control stalk to the central position.
## AUTOMATIC ILLUMINATION OF LAMPS
With the lighting control stalk in the "AUTO" position and if a low level of exterior brightness is detected by the rain/sunshine sensor, the sidelamps and dipped beam headlamps are switched on automatically, without any action on the part of the driver. They may also come on if rain is detected, at the same time as automatic operation of the windscreen wipers.
As soon as the brightness returns to a sufficient level or after the windscreen wipers are switched off, the lamps are switched off automatically.
In the event of a malfunction of the rain/ sunshine sensor, the vehicle's lamps come on and this warning lamp is displayed on the instrument panel, accompanied by an audible signal and/or the display of a message. Have it checked by a Jeep Dealership.
NOTE In fog or snow, the rain/sunshine sensor may detect sufficient light. For this reason, the lighting will not come on automatically.
NOTE The inner surface of the windscreen may become misted up and affect the proper operation of the rain/sunshine sensor. In humid and cold weather, demist the windscreen regularly.
## Operating limits
The automatic lighting systems use a detection camera, located at the top of the windscreen.
The system may be disrupted or not work correctly:
- When visibility conditions are poor (e.g. snowfall, heavy rain)
- If the windscreen is dirty, misted-up or masked (e.g. sticker) in front of the camera
- the vehicle is facing highly reflective signs or safety barrier reflectors

In the lower position, the double load floor is able to withstand the maximum permissible load.
## LOADING INFORMATION
61)
Heavy objects in the load compartment should be placed against the seat backrests. Make sure that the backrests are securely engaged. If objects can be stacked, heavier objects should be placed at the bottom.
Prevent sliding of loose objects by securing them with straps attached to the lashing eyes.
Do not allow the load to protrude above the upper edge of the backrests.
Do not place any objects on the load compartment cover or the instrument panel, and do not cover the sensor on top of the instrument panel.
The load must not obstruct the operation of the pedals, parking brake and gear selector, or hinder the freedom of movement of the driver. Do not place any unsecured objects in the interior. Do not drive with an open load compartment.
The payload is the difference between the permitted gross vehicle weight (see identification plate) and the EC kerb weight To calculate the payload, enter the data for your vehicle in the weights table at the front of this manual.
The EC kerb weight includes weights for the driver (68 kg), luggage (7 kg) and all fluids (fuel tank 90% full).
Optional equipment and accessories increase the kerb weight.
Driving with a roof load increases the sensitivity of the vehicle to cross-winds and has a detrimental effect on vehicle handling due to the vehicle's higher centre of gravity. Distribute the load evenly and secure it properly with retaining straps. Adjust the tyre pressure and vehicle speed according to the load conditions. Check and retighten the straps frequently.
Do not drive faster than 120 km/h. The permissible roof load is 50 kg. The roof load is the combined weight of the roof rack and the load.

## ENGINE EXHAUST
(where provided)
## EXHAUST FILTER
## Automatic cleaning process
The exhaust filter system filters soot particles out of the exhaust gases. The start of saturation of the exhaust filter is indicated by the temporary illumination of accompanied by a message in the instrument panel display. As soon as the traffic conditions permit, regenerate the filter by driving at a vehicle speed of at least 60 km/h until the control indicator extinguishes.
NOTE On a new vehicle, the first exhaust filter regeneration operations may be accompanied by a burning smell, which is normal. Following prolonged operation of the vehicle at very low speed or at idle, water vapour can be emitted at the exhaust on acceleration. This does not affect the behaviour of the vehicle or the environment.
## Cleaning process not possible
If stays on, accompanied by an audible signal and a message, this indicates that the exhaust filter additive level is too low.
The reservoir must be topped-up without delay. Seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership.
## Catalytic converter
The catalytic converter reduces the amount of harmful substances in the exhaust gases.
In the event of misfiring, uneven engine running, a reduction in engine performance or other unusual problems, have the cause of the fault rectified by a Jeep Dealership as soon as possible. In an emergency, driving can be continued for a short period, keeping vehicle speed and engine speed low.
## WARNING
67) Engine exhaust gases contain poisonous carbon monoxide, which is colourless and odourless and could be fatal if inhaled. If exhaust gases enter the interior of the vehicle, open the windows. Have the cause of the fault rectified by a Jeep Dealership. Avoid driving with an open load compartment, otherwise exhaust gases could enter the vehicle.
## IMPORTANT
35) Fuel grades other than those listed in the "Fuel" chapter could damage the catalytic converter or electronic components. Unburnt petrol will overheat and damage the catalytic converter.

## PRECAUTIONS RELATING TO THE HIGH VOLTAGE SYSTEM
(Electric versions)
71) 72) 73) 74) 75) 76)
## WORKS ON THE HIGH-VOLTAGE SYSTEM
The vehicle's high-voltage system: is isolated from the vehicle and is secured by protective equipment; is protected from the outside environment;
is only accessible for maintenance work by qualified personnel.
The vehicle monitors the integrity of the high-voltage system: if a fault is detected, a dedicated message will appear on the instrument panel display together with the relevant icon.
## Warnings
In case of fault, damage or fire to the vehicle:
the components of the high-voltage system can be live and the high-voltage battery can be charged;
the high-voltage battery, cables and electrical components may be exposed and pose a potential risk of electrocution;
vapours released during handling or disconnection of the high-voltage battery from the system are potentially toxic and flammable;
damage to the vehicle or high-voltage battery may cause immediate or delayed release of toxic and/or flammable gases or a fire;
The high-voltage components are orange.
WARNING Non-insulated cables or wires may be visible inside or outside the car. Never touch cables and/or connectors: electric shock could occur, resulting in injury or death by electrocution.
WARNING Do not touch, disassemble or remove the electric climate control compressor.
WARNING Do not touch / disassemble / remove the high-voltage battery.
## WARNING
- 71) Improperly performed work, in particular maintenance and repair work on the high-voltage system, can result in current leakage: risk of injury, burns or death. Any maintenance, repair or modification work must usually be carried out by qualified technicians.
- 72) According to ECE100 standard, the label is affixed to the vehicle's highvoltage components with which the driver may come into direct or indirect contact.
- 73) The components of the high-voltage system are not repairable. All high voltage wiring harness is orange. If necessary, contact the Jeep Dealership for servicing or repair work. NEVER touch the orange wiring harness. Severe injury or death by
electric shock could result if the highvoltage system components are damaged.
- 74) Do not pour water or any other kind of liquid into the boot. Even if insulated by specific protections, high voltage components are mounted. Risk of death by electrocution.
- 75) Never perform any operation on high voltage components. In case of need, contact a Jeep Dealership.
- 76) Even if the high-voltage battery is flat, the high-voltage system will still remain live - danger of fire or fatal injury. Do not touch or modify live parts in any way (e.g. orange cables, even with discharged highvoltage batteries).
## ACTIVE SAFETY SISTEMS
## ABS SYSTEM (Antilock Brake System)
77) 78) 79) 80) 81) 82) 83)
Antilock brake system (ABS) prevents the wheels from locking.
ABS starts to regulate brake pressure as soon as a wheel shows a tendency to lock. The vehicle remains steerable, even during hard braking.
ABS control is made apparent through a pulse in the brake pedal and the noise of the regulation process.
For optimum braking, keep the brake pedal fully depressed throughout the braking process, despite the fact that the pedal is pulsating.Do not reduce the pressure on the pedal.
When braking in an emergency, the hazard warning flashers are switched on automatically depending on the force of deceleration. They are switched off automatically the first time you accelerate.
After starting off, the system performs a self-test which may be audible.
125
## Fault
84)
Have the cause of the fault remedied by a Jeep Dealership.
## BRAKE ASSIST
If brake pedal is depressed quickly and forcefully, maximum brake force is automatically applied. Operation of brake assist might become apparent by a pulse in the brake pedal and a greater resistance when depressing the brake pedal. Maintain steady pressure on the brake pedal as long as full braking is required. Maximum brake force is automatically reduced when brake pedal is released.
JJ000144
## DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) SYSTEM AND TSC (Traction Control System)
## 79) 80) 81) 82) 83)
Dynamic Stability Control improves driving stability when necessary, regardless of the type of road surface or tyre grip
As soon as the vehicle starts to swerve (understeer / oversteer), engine output is reduced and the wheels are braked individually.
Dynamic Stability Control operates in combination with the Traction Control system. It prevents the driven wheels from spinning.
The Traction Control system is a component of the Dynamic Stability Control.
The Traction Control system improves driving stability when necessary, regardless of the type of road surface or tyre grip, by preventing the driven wheels from spinning.
As soon as the driven wheels starts to spin, engine output is reduced and the wheel spinning the most is braked individually. This considerably improves the driving stability of the vehicle on slippery road surfaces.
Dynamic Stability Control and the Traction Control system are operational after each engine start as soon as the control indicator extinguishes
When Dynamic Stability Control or the Traction Control system operates, flashes.
On some occasions, e.g. after disconnecting the conventional battery, the control indicator may illuminate during some seconds accompanied by a message in the instrument panel display. This may be caused by the reset of the steering angle sensor.
## Deactivation
The Traction Control system can be deactivated in the instrument panel display.
Deactivation is confirmed by a message in the instrument panel display.
## Fault
If there is a fault in the system, the control indicator illuminates continuously, a message appears in the instrument panel display and a warning chime sounds. The system is not operational. Have the cause of the fault remedied by a Jeep Dealership.
## HSA (Hill Start Assist) SYSTEM (Where provided)
This system keeps the vehicle briefly stationary (for approximately 2 seconds) when making a hill start, while you transfer your foot from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal.
The system is only active when:
the vehicle is completely stationary, with your foot on the brake pedal
87
SAFETY
88
certain slope conditions are met the driver's door is closed
NOTE The Hill Start Assist function cannot be deactivated. However, using the parking brake to immobilise the vehicle interrupts its operation.
## Operation
126 JJ000727 Facing uphill, with the vehicle stationary, the vehicle is held for a short time when the driver releases the brake pedal if mode D is selected on the Electric Drive Unit.
127 JJ000728 Facing downhill, with the vehicle stationary and reverse gear engaged, the vehicle is held for a short time when the driver releases the brake pedal.
## Malfunction
If the event of a malfunction, warning lamps and light up on the instrument panel. Have it checked by a Jeep Dealership.
## HDC SYSTEM (Hill Descent Control)
(Where provided)
Hill Descent Control system for medium to steep slopes, on tarmac or other road surfaces (e.g. gravel, mud).
This system reduces the risk of slip or loss of control of the vehicle when descending, whether going forward or in reverse.
During a descent, the system assists the driver in maintaining a constant speed,
depending on the gear engaged, while progressively releasing the brakes.
NOTE For the system to activate, the gradient must be greater than 5%. The system can be used with the gear lever in gear engaged position (for manual gearbox) or with the gear selector at N, D or R (for Electric Drive Unit).
## Switching on
By default, the system is not selected. The state of the function is not saved when the ignition is switched off.
JJ000356
To select the system, at speeds below 50 km/h (31 mph), press the button fig. 128 until its indicator lights up; this lamp appears in green in the instrument panel. The system becomes active at speeds below 30 km/h (19 mph).
- When the vehicle begins its descent, the driver can release the accelerator and brake pedals; the system regulates the speed:
- If the gearbox is in a position
different from neutral, the speed is maintained constant and the indicator lamp flashes rapidly
- If the gearbox is in neutral, the speed decreases and the indicator lamp flashes slowly; in this case. The speed maintained decreases when the slope increases
WARNING For versions with manual gearbox: with the gearbox in neutral the function is active when the gradient of the slope is greater than 15%.
On a descent, with the vehicle stationary, if the driver releases the accelerator and brake pedals, the system will release the brakes to set the vehicle gradually in motion.
The brake lamps light up automatically when the system is regulating.
## Pause
If the speed is grater than 30 km/h (19 mph) and lower than 50 km/h (31 mph), regulation is paused automatically, the indicator lamp goes back to grey in the instrument panel, but the green indicator lamp in the button remains on.
Regulation resumes automatically when the speed falls below 30 km/h (19 mph) again, if the slope and pedal release conditions are met.
You can depress the accelerator or brake pedal again at any time.
## Switching off
- Press the button until its indicator lamp goes off; the indicator lamp on the instrument panel goes off.
At speeds above 70 km/h (43 mph), the system is automatically deactivated; the indicator lamps in the button and on the instrument panel display go off. To reactivate the system slow down below 50 km/h (31 mph).
The system is no longer available also if it's managed by the Adaptive cruise control. The indicator lamp on the button is switched off.
## Malfunction
In the event of a malfunction, this warning lamp comes on in green on the instrument panel, accompanied by the display of a message. Have the system checked by a Jeep Dealership.
## WARNING
- 77) If the ABS intervenes, this indicates that the grip of the tyres on the road is nearing its limit: you must slow down to a speed compatible with the available grip.
- 79) The system cannot overrule the natural laws of physics, and cannot increase the grip available according to the condition of the road.
- 78) To achieve maximum efficiency of the braking system, a settlement period of some hundred kilometers is required. During this time, avoid sudden, repeated and prolonged braking.
- 80) The system cannot prevent accidents, including those due to excessive speed on corners, driving on low-grip surfaces or aquaplaning.
- 81) The capability of the system must never be tested irresponsibly and dangerously, in such a way as to compromise personal safety and the safety of others.
- 82) For the correct operation of the system, the tyres must of necessity be the same make and type on all wheels, in perfect condition and, above all, of the prescribed type and dimensions.
- 83) The features must not induce the driver to take unnecessary or unwarranted risks. Your driving style must always be suited to the road conditions, visibility and traffic. The driver is, in any case, responsible for safe driving.
- 84) If there is a fault in the ABS, the wheels may be liable to lock due to braking that is heavier than normal. The advantages of ABS are no longer available. During hard braking, the vehicle can no longer be steered and may swerve. 85) Do not leave the vehicle while it is being held temporarily by Hill Start Assist. If someone needs to get out of the vehicle with the engine running, apply the parking brake manually. Then check that the lamp in the instrument cluster is on (fixed).
- 86) Prolonged use of the system may overheat the braking system. If the brakes overheat, the HDC system, when active, will be gradually deactivated after suitably informing the driver (LED on button off): it can be reactivated only when the brakes have cooled sufficiently. The distance
89
SAFETY
90
that can be covered depends on the temperature of the brakes and therefore on the gradient, load and speed of the car.
87) The performance of a car with HDC must never be tested in imprudent or dangerous ways, with the possibility of putting the safety of the driver or other people at risk.
- 88) When the system is regulating, the Automatic Braking System is automatically deactivated.
## DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS
## AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM
(where provided)
The Automatic Braking System may help to avoid or reduce the harm caused by front-end crashes.
JJ000386
129 The Automatic Braking System uses the front camera in the windscreen and depending on the vehicle configuration a radar unit located behind the front
bumper to detect vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians directly ahead, in the path (fig. 129).
If a vehicle directly ahead is approached too quickly, a warning chime sounds and a message is displayed in the instrument panel display.
## 89) 90) 91) 92) 93) 94) 95)
38) 39) 40) 41) 42) 43) 44) 45) 46)
WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in the "Starting and driving" section.
## Activation
The Automatic Braking System operates from 5 km/h to 140 km/h.
## Alerting the driver
The driver is warned by following alerts: A warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display, when the distance to the vehicle ahead gets too small.
A warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display and a warning chime sounds, when a collision is imminent and immediate driver's action is required.
## Selecting the alert sensitivity
Three alert sensitivities can be selected in the settings of the active emergency braking within the vehicle personalisation
The chosen setting will be memorised when the ignition has been switched off. The alert timing will vary based on selected alert setting.
## Deactivation
The system can only be deactivated by deactivating the active emergency braking in the vehicle personalisation. When ignition is switched on next time, system is activated.
## System limitations
Automatic Braking System is designed to warn on vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, but may react also to other objects.
In the following cases, Automatic Braking System may not detect a vehicle ahead or sensor performance is limited:
driving on winding or hilly roads driving during nighttime
weather limits visibility, such as fog, rain, or snow
the sensor in the windscreen or the radar unit behind the front bumper are blocked by snow, ice, slush, mud, dirt etc.
the windscreen is damaged or affected by foreign objects, e.g. stickers
the bumper is damaged or affected by foreign objects, e.g. license plate support
## Active emergency braking
Active emergency braking can help to reduce the damage and injury from crashes with vehicles and pedestrians directly ahead, when the driver does not
actively take action either by manual braking or by steering. For vehicles equipped with camera and radar, active emergency braking also detects cyclists. Before the active emergency braking applies, the driver is warned by the Automatic Braking System.
Active emergency braking can be deactivated in the vehicle personalisation. If deactivated, illuminates in the instrument panel display. When ignition is switched on next time, system is activated by default. The feature uses various inputs (e.g. camera sensor, radar sensor) to calculate the probability of a frontal collision.
## Functionality
Depending on the vehicle configuration and the detected objects, there are several operational speed ranges.
On vehicles equipped only with front camera, the active emergency braking operates from 5 km/h to 80 km/h when vehicles, cyclists or pedestrians have been detected.
On vehicles equipped with radar sensor and front camera, the active emergency braking operates from 5 km/h to 140 km/h when vehicles, cyclists or pedestrians have been detected.
Active emergency braking only works when the seat belts of the front seats and depending on version of the rear seats are fastened.
The system includes:
- brake preparation system
- emergency automatic braking
- smart brake assist
- front pedestrian protection
## Brake preparation system
When approaching a vehicle ahead or a pedestrian so quickly that a collision is likely, the brake preparation system slightly pressurises the brakes. This reduces the response time, when braking is requested.
## Emergency automatic braking
After activation of brake preparation system and just before the imminent collision, this function automatically applies braking to reduce the impact speed of the collision or prohibit a crash. If active emergency braking is applied, flashes in the instrument panel display.
Emergency automatic braking is designed to react on vehicles or pedestrians ahead. If the vehicle is equipped with camera and radar, it also reacts on cyclists ahead.
Below a speed of 50 km/h, emergency automatic braking may slow down the vehicle to a complete stop. If the speed exceeds 50 km/h, emergency automatic braking reduces the speed. For versions with camera and radar, the speed reduction may be extended to 50 km/h if both sensors are able to detect the hazard. However, the driver must apply the brake to come to a complete stop.
Electric Drive Unit: If the vehicle comes to a complete stop, automatic braking is maintained for a certain time. Keep the brake pedal depressed to prevent the vehicle from starting off again.
- Manual transmission: If the vehicle comes to a complete stop, the engine may stall.
Cruise control and adaptive cruise control will be deactivated when an emergency automatic braking occurs.
96)
## Smart brake assist
If the driver brakes, but not sufficiently to avoid a collision, this system will supplement the braking. This assistance will only be provided if the driver presses the brake pedal
Smart brake assist will automatically disengage when the brake pedal is released.
## System limitations
In some cases, the active emergency braking system may provide an automatic braking in situations that seem to be unnecessary, for instance in parking garages, due to various types of objects, i.e., traffic signs or vehicles in another lane. Firmly apply the accelerator pedal to override the automatic braking if the situation and the surroundings permit.
In the following cases, active emergency braking performance might be limited:
- driving on winding or hilly roads
91
SAFETY
92
- detecting vehicles with a trailer, tractors, muddy vehicles, etc.
detecting a vehicle when weather limits visibility, such as in fog, rain, or snow
driving during nighttime
the sensor in the windscreen or the radar unit behind the front bumper is blocked by snow, ice, slush, mud, dirt or by foreign objects, e.g. stickers the windscreen is damaged the bumper is damaged
Complete attention is always required while driving, and be ready to take action to avoid crashes.
We recommend to deactivate the system in the vehicle personalisation in the following cases:
when towing a trailer or caravan when carrying long objects on roof bars or a roof rack
when the vehicle is being towed with the engine running
when the vehicle is fitted with snow chains
when a spare wheel is fitted that is smaller than the other wheels
before using an automatic car wash with the engine running
before placing the vehicle on a rolling road in a Jeep Dealership
- if the windscreen has been damaged close to the camera
if the front bumper has been damaged if the brake lights are not working
## Fault
In case the system requires a service, a message is displayed in the instrument panel display.
If the system does not work properly, vehicle messages are displayed in the instrument panel display.
## FRONT PEDESTRIAN PROTECTION
(where provided)
Front pedestrian protection may help to avoid or reduce the harm caused by front-end crashes with pedestrians when driving forward.
130 JJ000386 The system uses the front camera in the windscreen and depending on the vehicle configuration a radar unit in the front bumper to detect a pedestrian directly ahead in the path (fig. 130).
WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in the "Starting and driving" section.
Front pedestrian protection can detect and alert to pedestrians in a forward gear at speeds between 5 km/h and 80 km/h. Additionally, it can automatically brake the vehicle.
During nighttime driving, system performance is limited.
The system can only be deactivated by deactivating the active emergency braking in the vehicle personalisation. When ignition is switched on next time, system is activated.
## Front pedestrian alert
When approaching a detected pedestrian too quickly, a warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display. A warning chime is provided. Cruise control or adaptive cruise control may be disengaged when the front pedestrian alert occurs.
## System limitations
In the following cases, front pedestrian protection may not detect a pedestrian ahead or sensor performance is limited:
- driving on winding or hilly roads
- driving in the dark
- weather limits visibility, such as fog, rain, or snow
the sensor in the windscreen or the radar unit behind the front bumper is blocked by snow, ice, slush, mud, dirt or by foreign objects, e.g. stickers the windscreen is damaged the bumper is damaged
## Crossing the road with another vehicle
131 JJ000768 1: Left-hand drive - 2: Right-hand drive The system may operate when the vehicle is turning and detects another vehicle, on the adjacent lane, approaching from the opposite direction if:
- The corresponding turn signal indicator is activated
- Then the vehicle is about to cross the path of another vehicle.
- The spees of the own vehicle is between 8 and 25 km/h
A collision on the side of the other vehicle is probable
## BLIND SPOT ALERT
(where provided)
Blind Spot Alert helps to avoid crashes due to lane changes when an object is detected within a specified blind spot zone.
The system displays a visual alert in each exterior mirror, when detecting objects that may not be visible in the interior and exterior mirrors.
Blind Spot Alert uses some of the advanced parking assist sensors which are located in the front and rear bumper on both sides of the vehicle.
99)
WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in the "Starting and driving" section.
## Activation
The system can be activated via the vehicle settings menu in the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV .
WARNING The system is automatically deactivated when towing with a towing device approved by Jeep.
## Functionality
132 JJ000496 When the system detects a vehicle in the side blind zone while driving forwards, an LED will illuminate in the relevant exterior mirror fig. 132:
fixed, immediately when another vehicle is in the blind spot or is approaching in an adjacent lane flashing, after about 1 second when the direction indicator is used
## OPERATION CONDITIONS
The following conditions must be fulfilled for proper operation:
all vehicles are moving in the same direction and in adjacent lanes depending on the configuration of the vehicle, the speed of your vehicle is between 12 or 33 and 140 km/h
passing a vehicle with a speed difference of less than 12 km/h
- another vehicle is passing with a speed difference of less than 30 km/h
the traffic flow is normal
93
SAFETY
94
driving on a straight or slightly curved road
the vehicle is not pulling a trailer the sensors are not covered by mud, ice or snow
the warning zones in the door mirrors or the detection zones on front and rear bumper are not covered with adhesive labels or other objects
No alert will be given in the following situations:
in the presence of non-moving objects, e.g. parked vehicles, barriers, street lamps, road signs
in very dense traffic, when moving vehicles might be confused with a stationary object
with vehicles moving in the opposite direction
driving on a winding road or a sharp corner
when passing or being passed by a very long vehicle, e.g. lorry, coach, which is at the same time detected at the rear in the blind spot angle and present in the driver's forward field of vision when passing too quickly
## Deactivation
The system can be deactivated via the vehicle settings menu in the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV .
The state of the system is memorised when switching off the ignition.
The system is automatically deactivated when towing an electrically connected trailer.
Due to adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain, false detections may occur.
## Fault
In the event of a fault, illuminates in the instrument panel, accompanied a display message. Contact a Jeep Dealership to have the system checked.
## DRIVER ALERT
(where provided)
The driver alert system monitores the driving time and the vigilance of the driver. Monitoring the vigilance of the driver is based on the trajectory variations of the vehicle compared to the lane markings.
The system cannot replace the need for vigilance on the part of the driver. Taking a break is recommended as soon as feeling tired or at least every 2 hours. Do not drive when feeling tired.
WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in the "Starting and driving" section.
## Activation or Deactivation
This system can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
If deactivated, the system is automatically on when ignition is switched on.
## Driving time alert
The driver gets notified by a pop-up reminder symbol in the instrument panel display simultaneously with an acoustic alert if the driver has not taken a break after 2 hours of driving at a speed above 65 km/h. The alert is repeated hourly until the vehicle is stopped, no matter how vehicle speed evolves.
The counting of driving time alert is reset when the ignition has been switched off for a few minutes.
## Driver Attention Alert
(for versions/markets where provided) The system monitors the driver's level of vigilance at speeds above 65 km/h. A camera at the top of the windscreen detects variations in trajectory compared to the lane markings.
If the trajectory of the vehicle suggests a certain level of drowsiness or inattention by the driver, the system triggers the first level of alert. The driver is notified by a message and an audible signal is given. The symbol appears on the display.
After three first level alerts, the system triggers a new alert with a message, accompanied by a more pronounced audible signal.
In certain driving conditions such as poor road surface or strong winds etc., the system may give alerts independent of the driver's level of vigilance.
The driver drowsiness detection is reinitialised when the ignition has been switched off for a few minutes or the speed remains below 65 km/h for a few minutes.
## System limitations
In the following situations, the system may not operate properly or even not operate at all:
poor visibility caused by inadequate lighting of the roadway, falling snow, heavy rain, dense fog etc.
dazzle caused by headlamps of oncoming vehicles, low sun, reflections on damp roads, leaving a tunnel, alternating shade and light etc.
- windscreen area in front of the camera covered by dirt, snow, stickers etc.
- no lane markings detected or multiple lane markings due to roadworks
- close vehicles ahead
- winding roads or narrow roads
## TYRE UNDERINFLATION DETECTION SYSTEM
100) 101) 102) 103)
The Tyre Underinflation Detection System continually checks the rotation speed of all four wheels and warns on low tyre pressure condition once vehicle is driving. This is achieved by comparing
tyre rolling circumference with reference values and further signals.
If a tyre loses pressure the control indicator illuminates and a warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display.
In this case reduce speed, avoid sharp cornering and strong braking. Stop at next safe opportunity and check tyre pressure.
After adjusting tyre pressure initialise system to extinguish the control indicator and restart system.
If the failure continues to be displayed, contact a Jeep Dealership. The system is inoperable when the ABS or Electronic Stability Control has a malfunction or a temporary spare wheel is used. Once the tyre has been refitted, check the tyre pressure with cold tyres and initialise the system.
## System initialisation
After tyre pressure correction or wheel change, the system must be initialised to learn new circumference reference values:
Always ensure that all four tyres have correct tyre pressure.
- Apply parking brake.
- Initialise the system via the
Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV fig. 133 (Settings&gt;Vehicle&gt;Safety).
133
JJ000711
Reset is confirmed by pop-up indication.
After initialisation system automatically calibrates to new tyre pressures during driving. After longer drive the system will adopt and monitor new pressures.
The Tyre Underinflation Detection signals the driver a possible insufficient pressure if this falls below the warning limit for any reason.
Always check tyre pressure with cold tyres.
System has to be reinitialised when:
- Tyre pressure has been changed
Load condition has been changed
- Wheels have been swapped or exchanged
- Tyre pressure is affected by temperature decrease
When the space-saver wheel is fitted In these cases the system can require a Reset. If the signals persist, contact a Jeep Dealership.
95
SAFETY
96
## WARNING
- 89) The system is an aid for car driving, it DOES NOT warn the driver about incoming cars outside of the detection areas. The driver must always maintain a sufficient level of attention to the traffic and road conditions and for controlling the trajectory of the vehicle.
- 90) The system is an aid for the driver, who must always pay full attention while driving. The responsibility always rests with the driver, who must take into account the traffic conditions in order to drive in complete safety. The driver must always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
- 91) The capability of the system must never be tested irresponsibly and dangerously, in such a way as to compromise personal safety and the safety of others.
- 92) If the driver presses the accelerator pedal fully or steers abruptly during system operation, the automatic braking function may stop (e.g. to allow a possible manoeuvre to avoid the obstacle).
- 93) The system intervenes on vehicles travelling in the same lane. Animals and things (e.g. pushchairs) are not taken into consideration.
- 94) If the car must be placed on a roller bench for maintenance or if it is washed in an automatic car wash with an obstacle in the front part (e.g. another car, a wall or another obstacle), the system may detect its presence and activate. In this case the system must be deactivated
- through the settings of the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV system.
- 95) The radar (if installed) is provided with defrosting system. For this reason, it can reach high temperatures in some conditions. If you need to operate in the zone surrounding the sensor, wait for at least 30 seconds from when the engine is switched off.
- 96) Do not rely on the system to brake the vehicle. Emergency automatic braking will not brake outside of its operating speed range and only responds to detected vehicles and pedestrians.
- 97) The usage of a license plate support on the front bumper may affect the proper radar unit functionality. When using a license plate support, follow the markings and indications on the front bumper.
- 98) Front pedestrian braking does not provide an alert or automatically brake the vehicle, unless it detects a pedestrian. The system may not detect pedestrians, including children, when the pedestrian is not directly ahead, not fully visible, not standing upright, or when part of a group. 99) Blind Spot Alert is only a driving assistance and must not replace the driver vigilance and responsibility. It's only a lane changing aid and does not replace driver vision. Blind Spot Alert does not detect: vehicles outside the side blind zones which may be rapidly approaching; pedestrians or animals; non-moving objects, e.g. stationary vehicles, street lights, road signs, etc.
- Failure to use proper care when changing lanes may result in damage to the vehicle, injury, or death. Always check the outside and rearview mirrors, glance over your
- shoulder, and use the turn signal before changing lanes.
- 100) The presence of the Tyre Underinflation Detection System does not permit the driver to neglect regular checks of the tyre pressure, including for the spare wheel, and correct maintenance. The system is not used to signal a possible tyre failure.
- 101) Tyre pressure must be checked with tyres rested and cold. Should it become necessary for whatever reason to check pressure with warm tyres, do not reduce pressure even though it is higher than the prescribed value. Repeat the check when the tyres are cold.
- 102) The Tyre Underinflation Detection System cannot indicate sudden tyre pressure drops (for example when a tyre bursts). In this case, stop the vehicle, braking with caution and avoiding abrupt steering.
- 103) Changes in outside temperature may cause tire pressures to vary. The system may temporarily indicate insufficient pressure. In this case check the tire inflation pressure with the tires cold and, if necessary top up the inflation pressure.
## IMPORTANT
- 38) The system may have limited operation or not work at all in weather conditions such as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow.
- 39) The section of the bumper in front the sensor must not be covered with stickers, auxiliary headlights or any other object.
- 40) System intervention might be unexpected or delayed when other cars transport loads projecting from the side, above or from the rear, with respect to the normal size of the car.
- 41) Operation can be adversely affected by any structural change made to the vehicle, such as a modification to the front geometry, tyre change, or a heavier than standard load of the vehicle.
- 42) Incorrect repairs made on the front part of the car (e.g. bumper, chassis) may alter the position of the radar sensor (if installed), and adversely affect its operation. Go to a Jeep Dealership for any operation of this type.
- 43) Do not tamper with or carry out any intervention on the radar sensor (if installed) or on the camera on the windscreen glass. In the event of a sensor failure, contact a Jeep Dealership.
- 44) When towing a trailer (with modules installed after purchasing the car), a vehicle or during loading manoeuvres on a car carrier (or in vehicle for transport), the system must be deactivated via the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV system. 45) Do not wash with high-pressure jets in the bumper lower area: in particular do not operate on the system's electrical connector.
- 46) Be careful in the case of repairs and new paintings in the area around the radar sensor (if installed) (trim covering the radar sensor in the central part of the bumper). In the event of a frontal impact the sensor may automatically deactivate and display a warning to indicate that the radar sensor needs to be repaired. Even without a malfunction warning, deactivate the system operation if you
think that the position of the radar sensor (if installed) has changed (e.g. due to lowspeed frontal impact as during parking manoeuvres). In these cases, go to a Jeep Dealership to have the radar sensor (if installed) realigned or replaced.
## PEDESTRIAN SAFETY ALERT
(Electric versions)
This system alerts pedestrians that the vehicle is approaching, when driving in all-electric.
The pedestrian horn operates once the vehicle is moving and at speeds of up to 30 km/h (19 mph), in forward or reverse gear.
This function cannot be deactivated.
104)
## WARNING
- 104) The pedestrian acoustic warning system is a driving aid and was not designed to avoid collisions. The driver must never reduce their level of attention while driving. Driving is always the responsibility of the driver, who must take into consideration the traffic conditions to drive in complete safety. The driver is always required to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front and from any persons and/or animals located near the car. Failure to observe what is described could cause a collision or
serious injuries to persons and/or animals located near the car.

## SEAT BELTS
The driver is responsible for respecting, and ensuring that all the other occupants of the vehicle also respect, the local laws in force in relation to the use of the seat belts.
Always fasten the seat belts before setting off.
The seat belts are locked during heavy acceleration or deceleration of the vehicle, holding the occupants in the seat position. Therefore the risk of injury is considerably reduced.
The retractor may lock when the car is parked on a steep slope: this is perfectly normal. Furthermore, the reel mechanism locks the belt if it is pulled sharply or in the event of sudden braking, collisions and high-speed bends.
Seat belts are designed to be used by only one person at a time.
Periodically check all parts of the belt system for damage, soiling and proper functionality.
Have damaged components replaced. After an accident, have the seat belts and triggered belt pretensioners replaced by a Jeep Dealership.
WARNING Make sure that the belts are not damaged by shoes or sharp-edged objects or trapped. Prevent dirt from getting into the belt retractors.
WARNING Use the belt buckle intended for the respective seat belt when
fastening in order to ensure proper functionality.
Wear the rear seat belts as shown in fig. 134
## SEAT BELT REMINDER
Each seat is equipped with a seat belt reminder, indicated by a control indicator for the respective seat in the roof console.
## BELT FORCE LIMITERS
Stress on the body is reduced by the gradual release of the belt during a collision.
## Belt pretensioners
105) 106) 107) 108) 109)
The car is equipped with front and rear lateral seat belt pretensioners, which draw back the seat belts by several centimetres in the event of a strong frontal impact. This guarantees the perfect adherence of the seat belts to the
occupant's bodies before the retention action begins.
In the event of a head-on, rear-end or side-on collision of a certain severity, the front seat belts and the outer rear seat belts are tightened.
It is evident that the pretensioners have been activated when the belt withdraws toward the retractor.
Deployment of the belt pretensioners is indicated by continuous illumination of control indicator .
Triggered belt pretensioners must be replaced by a Jeep Dealership. Belt pretensioners can only be triggered once. A slight discharge of smoke may be produced during the activation of the pretensioner which is not harmful and does not involve any fire hazard.
The pretensioner does not require any maintenance or lubrication: any changes to its original conditions will invalidate its efficiency.
If, due to unusual natural events (floods, sea storms, etc.), the device has been affected by water and/or mud, contact a Jeep Dealership to have it replaced.
WARNING To obtain the highest degree of protection from the action of the pretensioner, wear the seat belt tight to the torso and pelvis.
WARNING Do not affix or install accessories or other objects that may interfere with the operation of the belt pretensioners. Do not make any
modifications to belt pretensioner components as this will invalidate the operating permit of your vehicle.

## GENERAL WARNING FOR USING THE SEAT BELTS
Respect and ensure that all the other occupants of the car comply with the
local laws in force regarding the use of seat belts.
Always fasten the seat belts before setting off.
The seat belt strap must not be twisted. The upper part must pass over the shoulder and cross the chest diagonally fig. 138. The lower part must adhere to the pelvis, not to the abdomen of the occupant. Never use devices (clips, clamps, etc.) that hold the seat belt away from your body.
138
J0A0149C
Each seat belt must be used by only one person. Never travel with a child sitting on the passenger's lap and a single belt to protect them both fig. 139. In general, do not place any objects between the person and the belt.

## USING SEAT BELTS WHILE PREGNANT
140 J0A0148C Seat belts must also be worn by pregnant women: the risk of injury in the event of an accident is reduced for them and the unborn child if they are wearing a seat belt.
Pregnant women must position the lower part of the belt very low down so that it passes over the pelvis and under the abdomen fig. 140. While pregnancy increases, the driver must adjust both seat and steering wheel to
have full control over the vehicle (pedals and steering wheel should be easily accessed). The maximum clearance should be kept between the abdomen and the steering wheel.
113)
## SEAT BELTS MAINTENANCE
For keeping the seat belts in efficient conditions, carefully observe the following warnings:
always use the seat belt well stretched and never twisted; make sure that it is free to run without obstructions check seat belt operation as follows: attach the seat belt and pull it hard replace the seat belt after an accident of a certain severity even if it does not appear to be damaged. Always replace the seat belt if the pretensioners were deployed
prevent the retractors from getting wet: their correct operation is only guaranteed if water does not get inside
replace the seat belt when it shows wear or cuts
## WARNING
105) Incorrect handling (e.g. removal or fitting of belts) can trigger the belt pretensioners.
- 106) The pretensioner may be used only once. Contact a Jeep Dealership to have it replaced after it has been deployed.
- 107) Removing or otherwise tampering with pretensioner and seat belt components is strictly prohibited. Any intervention on these components must be performed by qualified and authorised technicians. Always contact a Jeep Dealership.
- 108) For maximum safety, keep the backrest upright, lean back into it and make sure the seat belt fits closely across your chest and pelvis. Always fasten the seat belts for both the front and rear seats! Travelling without wearing seat belts will increase the risk of serious injury and even death in the event of an accident.
- 109) If the belt has been subjected to high levels of stress, for example after an accident, it should be changed completely together with the attachments, attachment fixing screws and the pretensioner. In fact, even if there are no visible defects, the belt could have lost its resistance properties.
- 110) Remember that, in the event of an accident, the rear seat passengers not wearing seat belts are exposed to a very serious risk and also represent a serious danger for the front seat occupants.
- 111) The belt must not rest against hard or fragile objects in the pockets of your clothing.
- 112) Never press the red button fig. 137 while driving.
- 113) The lap belt must be positioned as low as possible across the pelvis to prevent pressure on the abdomen.
## IMPORTANT
47) Operations which lead to impacts, vibrations or localised heating (over 100 ° C for a maximum of six hours) in the area around the pretensioner may cause damage or make it deploy. Contact a Jeep Dealership should intervention be necessary on these components.

belt is reeled in correctly. After folding or moving a seat or rear bench seat, ensure that the seat belt is positioned and reeled in correctly.
115) The lower part of the strap must be positioned as low as possible over the pelvis. The upper part must be positioned in the hollow of the shoulder. At the front, adjusting the position of the seat belt may require the seat height to be adjusted. In order to be effective, a seat belt must: be tightened as close to the body as possible; be pulled in front of you with a smooth movement, checking that it is not twisted; must only be used to secure one person; not show signs of tearing or fraying; not be changed or modified, in order to avoid affecting its performance. 116) Use a suitable child seat if the passenger is less than 12 years old or shorter than 1.5 metres. Never use the same seat belt to secure more than one child. Never carry a child on your lap. For more information on Child seats, refer to the "Child restraints" section.
117) In accordance with current safety regulations, for all work on your vehicle's seat belts, contact a Jeep Dealership with the skills and equipment needed. Have the seat belts checked regularly by a Jeep Dealership, particularly if the straps show signs of damage. Clean the seat belt straps with soapy water or a textile cleaning product, sold by Jeep Dealership.
## CHILD RESTRAINTS
## CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS
118) 119) 120) 121) 122)
For optimal protection in the event of an impact, all occupants must be seated and wearing adequate restraint systems, including newborn and other children. This prescription is compulsory in all EC countries according to EC Directive 2003/20/EC.
Children below the height of 1.50 meters and up to 12 years must be protected with suitable restraint systems and be seated on the rear seats.
According to crash statistics, children are safer when properly restrained in the rear seats, rather than in the front.
Compared with an adult, a child's head is larger and heavier in proportion to their body and the child's muscular and bone structures are not fully developed.
Therefore, correct restraint systems other than adult seat belts are necessary to reduce as much as possible the risk of injuries in the event of an accident, braking or sudden manoeuvre.
The choice of the most suitable child restraint system depends on the weight and size of the child. There are various types of child restraint systems, which can be secured to the vehicle by means of the seat belts or with the ISOFIX/iSize anchors.
Children must be seated safely and comfortably. Depending on the
characteristics of the child restraint systems used, you are advised to keep children in rearward-facing child restraint systems for as long as possible (at least until 3-4 years old), since this is the most protected position in the event of an impact.
It is recommended to always choose the restraint system most suitable for the child; for this reason always refer to the Owner Handbook provided with the child restraint system, to be sure that it is of the right type for the children it is intended for.
We recommend a child restraint system which is tailored specifically to the vehicle also. For further information, contact your Jeep Dealership.
In case of any interference of the child restraint system with vehicle seat head restraint, adjust or remove the corresponding head restraint.
When a child restraint system is being used, pay attention to the following usage and installation instructions and also those supplied with the child restraint system. Make sure that the front seats do not interfere with the used child restraint system.
Always comply with local or national regulations. In some countries, the use of child restraint systems is forbidden on certain seats.
Only drive with the driver seat correctly adjusted.
Child restraint systems can be fastened with:
- Three-point seat belt
- ISOFIX brackets
- Top-tether
## Three-point seat belt
Child restraint systems can be fastened by using a three-point seat belt. After fastening the child restraint system the seat belt has to be tightened.
## ISOFIX brackets
fig. 144 shows an example of a Universal ISOFIX child restraint system for weight group 1.
123) 124) 125) 126)
This system prevents the child seat from tipping forwards in the event of a front impact.
This ISOFIX mounting system provides fast, reliable and safe fitting of the child seat in the vehicle.
Fasten vehicle-approved ISOFIX child restraint systems to the ISOFIX brackets. Specific vehicle ISOFIX child restraint system positions are marked in the ISOFIX table.
142 JJ000677 (1) fig. 142 ISOFIX child restraints for the front passenger seat.
143 JJ000662 Open the zip (1) fig. 143 on the external rear seats to access to the ISOFIX child restraints for the rear seats.
When fastening ISOFIX child restraint systems on adjustable passenger seats, such as the front passenger seat (if the ISOFIX child restraint system is provided), first incline the backrest as far as necessary backwards in order to get access to the ISOFIX brackets. After the proper fastening of the ISOFIX child
restraint system, incline the backrest forward again.
WARNING When fitting an ISOFIX child seat to the left-hand rear seat of the bench seat, before fitting the seat, first move the centre rear seat belt towards the middle of the vehicle, so as to avoid the seat interfering with the operation of the seat belt.
An i-Size child restraint system is an universal ISOFIX child restraint system according UN Regulation No. 129.
All i-Size child restraint systems can be used on any vehicle seat suitable for iSize, i-Size table.
Either a Top-tether strap or a support leg must be used in addition to the ISOFIX brackets.
WARNING The fig. 144 is indicative and for assembly purposes only. Fit the child restraint system according to the instructions, which must be included.

J0A0326C
When a Universal ISOFIX child restraint system is used, only ECE R44 "ISOFIX Universal" (R44/03 or further upgrades) type-approved child restraint systems can be used (see fig. 145).
The other weight groups are covered by specific ISOFIX child restraint systems, which can be used only if specifically tested for this car (see list of cars provided with the child restraint system).
## i-Size child restraint system
These child restraint systems, built and type-approved according to the i-Size
(ECE R129) standard, ensure better safety conditions to carry children on board a vehicle:
the child must be transported rearward facing until 15 months;
child restraint system protection is increased in the event of a side collision;
the use of the ISOFIX system is promoted to avoid faulty installation of the child restraint system;
efficiency in the choice of the child restraint system, which isn't made according to weight any more but according to the child's height, is increased;
compatibility between the vehicle seats and the child restraint systems is better: the i-Size child restraint systems can be considered as "Super ISOFIX"; this means that they can be perfectly fitted in type-approved i-Size seats, but can also be fitted in ISOFIX (ECE R44) type-approved seats.
i-Size child seats have two latches that engage on the two rings fig. 143.
These i-Size child seats also have:
either an upper strap that is attached to ring fig. 148.
or a support leg that rests on the vehicle floor, compatible with the approved i-Size seat position
Their role is to prevent the child seat from tipping forward in the event of a collision.
NOTE If your car seats are i-Size approved, the symbol shown in fig. 146
will appear on the seats near the ISOFIX attachments.
## Top-tether anchors
- 148 In addition to the ISOFIX brackets, fasten the Top-tether strap to the Top-tether anchors.
JJ000502
ISOFIX child restraint systems of universal category positions are marked in the table by IUF.
To secure the child seat to the TOP TETHER:
- remove and stow the head restraint before installing the child seat on this seat (refit it once the child seat has been removed)
- pass the strap of the child seat behind the seat backrest, centring it between the openings for the head restraint rods secure the upper strap hook to ring fig. 148
- tighten the upper strap
## WARNING
118) An incorrectly installed child seat in a vehicle compromises the child's safety in the event of an accident. Strictly observe the fitting instructions provided in
- the user guide supplied with the child seat.
- 119) SEVERE DANGER When a front passenger airbag is fitted, do not install rearward facing child restraint systems on the front passenger seat. Deployment of the airbag in a crash could cause fatal injuries to the child regardless of the severity of the collision. It is advisable to always carry children in a child restraint system on the rear seat, which is the most protected position in the event of a collision.
- 120) There is a symbol on the label on the sun visor that illustrates the need to deactivate the air bag if you are installing a rear-facing child seat. Always comply with the instructions on the passenger side sun visor (see the "Airbag" chapter).
- 121) Should it be necessary to carry a child on the passenger side front seat in a rearward facing child restraint system, the passenger side front airbag and side bag must be deactivated through the key-operated switch in the glovebox, verifying deactivation by checking whether the OFF LED has switched on in the panel located on the ceiling. Move the passenger's seat as far back as possible to avoid contact between the child seat and the dashboard.
- 122) Do not move the front or rear seat if a child is seated on it or on the dedicated child restraint system.
- 123) Always make sure that the chest section of the seat belt does not pass under the arms or behind the back of the child. In the event of an accident the seat belt will not be able to secure the child, with the risk of injury, including fatal
- injury. Therefore the child must always wear the seat belt correctly.
- 124) Never use the same lower anchorage to attach more than one child restraint.
- 125) If a Universal ISOFIX child restraint system is not fixed to all three anchorages, it will not be able to protect the child correctly. In a crash, the child could be seriously or fatally injured.
- 126) Fit the child restraint system when the car is stationary. The child restraint system is correctly fixed to the brackets when you hear the click. Follow the instructions for assembly, disassembly and positioning that the Manufacturer must supply with the child restraint system.

In Europe the characteristics of child restraint systems are governed by regulation ECE-R44, which divides them into five weight groups.
The ECE-R44 standard has been paired with the ECE R-129 regulation, which defines the characteristics of the new i-Size child restraint systems (see the "Suitability of passenger seats for i-Size child restraint system use" paragraph).
| Group   | Age                             | Weight ranges                | Size class / Fixing   |
|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Group 0 | Indicatively up to 9 months     | up to 10 kg in weight        | ISO/L1 ISO/L2         |
|         | Indicatively up to 2 years      | up to 13 kg in weight ISO/R2 | Group 0+              |
|         |                                 |                              | ISO/R1                |

All restraint devices must bear the type-approval data, together with the control mark, on a label solidly fixed to the child restraint system which must never be removed.
The given restrictions in the table refer to a test body, which is the maximum envelope of all existing child restraint systems.
Lineaccessori MOPAR$_{®}$ includes child restraint systems for each weight group. These devices are recommended, having been specifically designed for Jeep cars.
WARNING For correct installation on the car, some universal child restraint systems require an accessory (base) sold separately by the restraint system's producer. Therefore, FCA recommends confirming the retailer if the desired child restraint system can be installed in the car by having it done, before buying the seat.
## INSTALLING A CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM WITH SEAT BELTS
127) 128) 129)
The Universal child restraint systems installed with the seat belts only are type-approved on the basis of the ECE R44 standard and are divided into various weight groups.
WARNING The figures are indicative and provided for assembly purposes only. Fit the child restraint system according to the instructions, which must be included.
WARNING Following an accident of a certain importance, it is recommended to replace both the child restraint system
and the seat belt to which it was bound.
## Group 0 and 0+
Infants up to 13 kg must be carried with a rearward facing child restraint system of the type shown in fig. 149 which, supporting the head, does not induce stress on the neck in the event of sudden decelerations.
The child restraint system is restrained by the vehicle seat belts, as shown in fig. 149 and it must restrain the child in turn with its own belts.
## Group 1
Children weighing from 9 to 18 kg may be transported in forward facing child restraint systems fig. 150.
150
JJ000504
## Group 2
Children from 15 to 25 kg may use the vehicle seat belts directly fig. 151. In this case, the child restraint system is used to position the child correctly with respect to the seat belts so that the diagonal belt section crosses the child's chest and not the neck, and the lower part is snug on the pelvis not the abdomen.
107
SAFETY
108
## Group 3
For children between 22 kg and 36 kg, there are boosters which allow the seat belt to be worn correctly.
The fig. 152 shows the correct child positioning on the rear seat.
Children over 1.50 m in height can wear seat belts like adults.
152
JJ000506
## SELECTING THE RIGHT SYSTEM
The rear seats are the most convenient location to fasten a child restraint system.
Children should travel facing rearwards in the vehicle as long as possible. This makes sure that the child's backbone, which is still very weak, is under less strain in the event of an accident. Do not use forward facing child restraint system at all seats when child's weight is below 13 kg.
Suitable are child restraint systems that comply with valid UN ECE regulations.
Check local laws and regulations for mandatory use of child restraint systems. The following child restraints are recommended for the following weight classes:
Group 0, 0+: Peg Perego Primo Viaggio I-size. To be installed in the opposite direction to the direction of travel with the mandatory use of the i-size sub-base
Group I: Peg Perego FF105. To be installed on the vehicle absolutely together with the Peg Perego Base I-size sub-base
Group II, III: Britax Römer KidFiX Isize. To be installed with ISOFIX. It is recommended use of belt clip for optimal lap belt routing
Group III booster child seat: Peg Perego 2-3 Shuttle booster. For children from 22 Kg to 36 Kg
Ensure that the child restraint system to be installed is compatible with the vehicle type.
Child seat at the front: Adjust the front passenger seat to the highest and fully back longitudinal position with the backrest straightened.
Child seat at the rear: Move the vehicle's front seat forward and straighten the backrest so that the legs of the child in the "forward facing" or the "rearward facing" child seat do not touch the vehicle's front seat.
In case of any interference of Child restraint system with vehicle seat head rest, adjust or remove the corresponding vehicle seat Head rest.
Do not use forward facing child restraints system when child's weight is below 13 kg at all seats.
Please follow Child restraint manufacturers instructions to install corresponding child restraints in vehicle.
For semi-universal or vehicle specific child restraint system (ISOFIX or belted child restraint system), see the vehicle list provided in the user manual of the child restraint system.
Ensure that the mounting location of the child restraint system within the vehicle is correct, see following table.
Allow children to enter and exit the vehicle only on the side facing away from the traffic.
When the child restraint system is not in use, secure the seat with a seat belt or remove it from the vehicle.
WARNING Do not affix anything on the child restraint systems and do not cover them with any other materials. A child restraint system which has been subjected to stress in an accident must be replaced.
## CHILD SEAT AT THE REAR

## WARNING
127) Incorrect fitting of the child restraint system may result in an inefficient protection system. In the event of an accident the child restraint system may become loose and the child may be injured, even fatally. When fitting a restraint system for newborns or children, strictly comply with the instructions provided by the Manufacturer.
- 128) When the child restraint system is not used, secure it with the seat belt or with the ISOFIX anchorages, or remove it from the car. Do not leave it unsecured inside the passenger compartment. In this way, in the event of sudden braking or an accident, it will not cause injuries to the occupants.
129) After installing a child restraint system in the car, do not move the seat forwards or back as it could loosen the attachments. Remove the child restraint system to adjust the seat position. Install the child restraint system again once the seat has been adjusted.

## MAIN WARNINGS TO CARRY CHILDREN SAFELY
- Install the child restraint systems on the rear seat, which is the most protected position in the event of a collision.
- Keep children in rearward facing child restraint systems for as long as possible, until 3 -4 years old if possible.
- The rear head restraint can be removed if needed to install a child restraint system.
The head restraint must always be present in the vehicle and fitted if the seat is used by an adult passenger or a child sitting in a restraint system without backrest.
- If the passenger's front airbag is deactivated always check the dedicated warning light on the trim located on the dashboard to make sure that it has actually been deactivated.
- Carefully follow the instructions supplied with the child restraint system. Keep the instructions in the car along with the other documents and this handbook. Do not use second-hand child seats without instructions.
Only one child is to be strapped into each restraint system; never carry two children using one child restraint system. Always check that the seat belts do not rest on the child's neck.
- Always check that the seat belt is well fastened by pulling on it.
- While travelling, do not let the child sit incorrectly or unfasten the belts.
- Never allow a child to put the belt's diagonal section under an arm or behind their back.
- Never carry children on your lap, even newborns. No-one can hold a child in the event of a collision
- If the car has been involved in a road accident, replace the child restraint system with a new one. In addition, and depending on the type of child restraint system installed, replace the ISOFIX anchors or the seat belt with which the child restraint system was connected.
## AIR BAG
The airbag system consists of a number of individual systems When triggered, the airbags inflate within milliseconds. They also deflate so quickly that it is often unnoticeable during the collision.
132) 133) 134) 135) 136) 137) 138)
WARNING The airbag systems and belt pretensioner control electronics are located in the centre console area. Do not put any magnetic objects in this area.
WARNING Do not affix any objects onto the airbag covers and do not cover them with other materials. Have damaged covers replaced by a Jeep Dealership.
WARNING Each airbag is triggered only once. Have deployed airbags replaced by a Jeep Dealership. Furthermore, it may be necessary to have the steering wheel, the instrument panel, parts of the panelling, the door seals, handles and the seats replaced.
WARNING Do not make any modifications to the airbag system as this will invalidate the vehicle operating permit.
## WARNING
- 132) The airbag system deploys in an explosive manner, repairs must be performed by skilled personnel only.
- 133) Adding accessories that change the vehicle's frame, bumper system, height, front end or side sheet metal, may keep the airbag system from working properly. The operation of the airbag system can also be affected by changing any parts of the front seats, seat belts, airbag sensing and diagnostic module, steering wheel, instrument panel, inner door seals including the speakers, any of the airbag modules, ceiling or pillar trim, front sensors, side impact sensors or airbag wiring.
- 134) Keep the area in which the airbag inflates clear of obstructions.
- 135) Do not apply stickers or other objects on the steering wheel, on the dashboard in the passenger side airbag area, on side upholstery on the roof or on the seats. Never put objects (e.g. mobile phones) on the passenger side of
117
SAFETY
118
the dashboard since they could interfere with correct inflation of the passenger airbag and also cause serious injury to the passengers.
136) The airbag must be able to inflate without obstruction in the event of deployment. It is therefore recommended not to drive with the body bent forward, but to sit up resting your back and shoulders on the backrest of the seat. Adjusting the position of the seat so that you can reach and manoeuvre the steering wheel comfortably with your arms slightly bent being as far away as possible from the steering wheel. Being too close to the steering wheel when the airbag is deployed may cause serious injury.
- 137) When there is an active passenger airbag, DO NOT install rearward facing child restraint systems on the front seat. Deployment of the airbag in a crash could cause fatal injuries to the child regardless of the severity of the collision. Therefore, always deactivate the passenger side airbag when a rearward facing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat. The front passenger seat must also be positioned back as far as possible in order to prevent the child restraint system from coming into contact with the dashboard. Immediately reactivate the passenger airbag as soon as the child restraint system has been removed.
138) The front airbags and/or side bags may be deployed if the car is subject to heavy knocks or accidents involving the underbody area, such as for example violent shocks against steps, pavements or low obstacles, the car falling in big holes or dips in the road.

## FRONT AIRBAG SYSTEM
The front driver/passenger airbags protect the front seat occupants in the event of frontal impacts of medium/high
severity, by placing the bag between the occupant and the steering wheel or dashboard.
The front airbag system consists of an instantly inflating bag contained in a special compartment in the centre of the steering wheel fig. 162 and one in the dashboard on the front passenger side fig. 163. These can be identified by the word AIRBAG .
WARNING Do not use particularly aggressive products to clean the steering wheel airbag cover.
The front airbag system is triggered in the event of a front-end impact of a certain severity. The ignition must be switched on.
Therefore non-activation of airbags in other types of collisions (side impacts, rear shunts, roll-overs, etc.) does not indicate a system malfunction.
The driver and passenger front airbags are not a replacement for, but are complementary to, the seat belts, which should always be worn as required by law in Europe and most non-European countries.
In the event of impact, anyone not wearing a seat belt is projected forwards and may come into contact with the bag while it is still inflating. The protection offered by the bag is compromised in these circumstances.
The front airbags may not activate in the case of a frontal impact against highly deformable objects not involving the front surface of the vehicle (e.g. wing collision against guard rail) or in the case of the vehicle wedging under other vehicles or protective barriers (e.g. under trucks or guard rails).
Failure to activate in the conditions described above is due to the fact that they may not provide any additional protection compared with seat belts, so their activation would be inappropriate. In these cases, non-deployment does not indicate a system malfunction.
162
JJ000481
JJ000508
The inflated airbags cushion the impact, thereby reducing the risk of injury to the upper body and head of the front seat occupants considerably.
139)
## SIDE AIRBAG SYSTEM
164 JJ000509 The side airbag system consists of an airbag in each front seat backrest. This can be identified by the word AIRBAG fig. 164.
The side airbag system is triggered in the event of a side impact of a certain
severity. The ignition must be switched on.
The inflated airbags cushion the impact, thereby reducing the risk of injury to the upper body and pelvis in the event of a side-on collision considerably.
WARNING Only use protective seat covers that have been approved for the vehicle. Be careful not to cover the airbags.
## CURTAIN AIRBAG SYSTEM
The curtain airbag system consists of an airbag in the roof frame on each side. This can be identified by the word AIRBAG on the roof pillars.
The curtain airbag system is triggered in the event of a side-on impact of a certain severity. The ignition must be switched on.
165 JJ000510 The inflated airbags cushion the impact, thereby reducing the risk of injury to the head in the event of a side-on impact considerably.
In the event of a side impact, the system provides best protection if the passenger sits on the seat in a correct position, thus allowing correct window bag deployment.
140) 141) 142) 143) 144) 145) 146) 147) 148) 149)
## Warnings
Do not wash the seats with water or pressurised steam (wash by hand or at automatic seat washing stations). The front airbags and/or side bags may be deployed in the event of sharp impacts to the underbody of the car (e.g. impact with steps, pavements, potholes or road bumps etc.).
When the airbag deploys it emits a small amount of dust: the dust is harmless and does not indicate the beginning of a fire. The dust may irritate the skin and eyes however: in this case, wash with neutral soap and water.
Airbag checking, repair and replacement must be carried out at a Jeep Dealership. If the car is scrapped, have the airbag system deactivated at a Jeep Dealership. Pretensioners and airbags are deployed in different ways on the basis of the type of collision. Failure to activate one or more of the devices does not indicate a system malfunction.
## AIRBAG DEACTIVATION
The front passenger airbag system must be deactivated for child restraint system on the passenger seat according to the
123
SAFETY
124
instructions in the table "Child restraint installation locations".
The side airbag and curtain airbag systems, the belt pretensioners and all driver airbag systems will remain active.
166 JJ000511 The front passenger airbag system can be deactivated via a key-operated switch in the glovebox fig. 166.
Use the ignition key to choose the position:
OFF : front passenger airbag is deactivated and will not inflate in the event of a collision, control indicator OFF illuminates continuously in the centre console.
ON : front passenger airbag is active.
WARNING After turning the key-operated switch to position OFF , keep on turning towards this position until key is removed.
167 JJ000512 If the control indicator fig. 167 illuminates for approx. 60 seconds after the ignition is switched on, the front passenger airbag system will inflate in the event of a collision.
If the control indicator illuminates after the ignition is switched on, the front passenger airbag system is deactivated. It stays on while the airbag is deactivated.
If both control indicators are illuminated at the same time, there is a system failure. The status of the system is not discernible, therefore no person is allowed to occupy the front passenger seat. Contact a Jeep Dealership immediately.
Consult a Jeep Dealership immediately if neither of the two control indicators are illuminated.
Change status only when the vehicle is stopped with the ignition off.
Status remains until the next change.
## AIRBAG AND BELT TENSIONERS FAULT LAMP
If it the lamp illuminates whilst driving, there is a fault in the airbag system. Seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership. The airbags and belt pretensioners may fail to trigger in the event of an accident.
151)
## WARNING
- 139) Optimum protection is only provided when the seat is in the proper position. Fasten the seat belt correctly and engage securely. Only then is the airbag able to protect.
- 140) The hooks on the handles in the roof frame are only suitable for hanging up light articles of clothing, without coat hangers. Do not keep any items in these clothes
- 141) Do not rest your head, arms or elbows on the door, on the windows or in the window bag area to prevent injury during deployment.
- 142) Never lean your head, arms or elbows out of the window.
143) If the warning light does not switch on or stays on whilst driving when the ignition device is turned to ENGINE, a failure may have occurred in the restraint systems. In this case the airbags or pretensioners may not be deployed in an impact or, in a lower number of cases, they may be deployed accidentally. Before continuing, contact a Jeep Dealership to have the system immediately checked.
- 144) On cars with side bags, do not cover the front seat backrests with extra covers.
- 145) Do not travel with objects in your lap, in front of your chest or held in your mouth (e.g., pipe, pencil etc.). They could cause severe injury if the airbag is deployed in a crash.
- 146) If the car has been stolen or in the case of attempt to steal it, if it has been subjected to vandalism or floods, have the airbag system checked by a Jeep Dealership.
- 147) If the ignition device is at ENGINE, even if the engine is switched off, airbags may be deployed when the car is stationary and hit by another car. Therefore, even if the vehicle is stationary, when an active front passenger airbag is fitted, DO NOT install rearward facing child restraint systems on the front passenger seat. Deployment of the airbag following an impact could cause fatal injuries to the child. Therefore, always deactivate the passenger side airbag when a rearward facing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat. The front passenger seat must also be positioned back as far as possible in order to prevent the child restraint system from coming into contact with the dashboard. Immediately reactivate the passenger airbag as soon as the child restraint system has been removed. Also remember that, if the ignition device is set to STOP, none of the safety devices (airbags or pretensioners) will be deployed in the event of collision. Non-deployment in such cases does not indicate a system malfunction.
- 148) The front airbag deployment threshold is higher than that of the pretensioners. For impacts whose intensity falls between the two levels, normally, only the pretensioners will be activated.
- 149) The airbag does not replace seat belts but increases their efficiency. Because front airbags are not deployed for low-speed crashes, side collisions, rear-end shunts or rollovers, occupants are protected, in addition to any side bags, only by their seat belts, which must therefore always be fastened.
- 150) Deactivate passenger airbag only in combination with the use of a child restraint system, subject to the instructions and restrictions in the table "Child restraint installation locations". Otherwise, there is a risk of fatal injury for a person occupying a seat with a deactivated front passenger airbag.
- 151) Malfunction of the airbag failure warning light is indicated by the activation of the airbag failure lamp and by a dedicated message on the instrument panel display. The pyrotechnic charges are not disabled. Before continuing, contact a Jeep Dealership immediately to have the system checked.

## Operation in case of failure
170 JJ000513 If either the electronic key fails or the battery of the electronic key is weak, a message may be displayed in the instrument panel display.
Hold the electronic key at the marking on the steering column cover as shown in the illustration fig. 170.
On vehicles with manual transmission, select neutral gear, operate the clutch pedal, the brake pedal and press the STOP START ENGINE button.
On vehicles with Electric Drive Unit, set the PRND command to position P, operate the brake pedal and press the STOP START ENGINE button.
This option is intended for emergencies only. Replace the electronic key battery as soon as possible.
For unlocking or locking the doors, see "Doors" chapter in "Knowing your car" section.
## ELECTRIC VERSIONS
153)
The PRND command must be in position P or N. Proceed as follows:
- fully depress the brake pedal without touching the accelerator
press the STOP START ENGINE button to take the ignition switch to the position 3. Hold it fully depressed for a couple of seconds.
At the end of the procedure, an acoustic warning will be heard and the message "READY" will appear on the instrument panel display to indicate that the electric traction system of the car has started. When the "READY" message appears, the car is ready to go.
## EMERGENCY SHUT OFF DURING DRIVING
If the engine needs to be switched off during driving in case of emergency, press the STOP START ENGINE button for 5 seconds.
157)
## COLD START RECOMMENDATIONS
Starting the engine without additional heaters is possible down to -30 ° C for petrol engines. Required is an engine oil with the correct viscosity, the correct fuel, performed services and a sufficiently charged conventional vehicle battery. It is necessary to do as follows: run the engine (idle speed) at least 1 min before take-off vehicle
- in very cold conditions, the enjoyability of use will be reached after a few kilometres
## TURBO ENGINE WARM-UP
Upon start-up, engine available torque may be limited for a short time, especially when the engine temperature is cold. The limitation is to allow the lubrication system to fully protect the engine.
## OVERRUN CUT-OFF
The fuel supply is automatically cut off during overrun, i.e. when the vehicle is driven with a gear engaged but accelerator pedal is released.
Depending on driving conditions, the overrun cut-off may be deactivated.
## WARNING
152) It is dangerous to run the engine in enclosed areas. The engine consumes oxygen and engine exhaust contains
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic gasses.
- 153) The brake servo is not active until the engine is started, so you would need to apply much more force than usual to the brake pedal.
- 154) Do not start the engine by pushing, towing or driving downhill. These manoeuvres may damage the catalytic converter.
- 155) Do not leave the vehicle in a poorly ventilated area with electrical operating mode on and heat engine switched off, as the heat engine may start automatically if the residual charge level of the high-voltage battery is insufficient. The exhaust gases generated can cause serious damage to people and animals.
- 156) When leaving the vehicle, you must set the PRND command to P. If you unintentionally press the accelerator pedal or when the PRND command is in a position other than P the vehicle can move abruptly, resulting in serious injury or death.
- 157) Switching off the engine during driving may cause loss of power support for brake and steering systems. Assistance systems and airbag systems are disabled. Lighting and brake lights will extinguish. Therefore power down the engine and ignition while driving only when required in case of emergency.
## IMPORTANT
48) When the engine is switched off never leave the ignition device in the ENGINE position to prevent useless current
129
STARTING AND DRIVING
130
absorption from draining the conventional battery.
- 49) A quick burst on the accelerator before turning off the engine serves absolutely no practical purpose; it wastes fuel and is damaging for the engine. 50) We recommend that during the initial period, or during the first 1600 km (1000 miles), you do not drive to full car performance (e.g. excessive acceleration, long journeys at top speed, sharp braking, etc.).
## PARKING
158) 159)
Always remove the key from the ignition device when leaving the car.
When parking and leaving the car, proceed as follows:
On versions equipped with the manual transmission, engage the gear (on a slope, engage 1st gear if the vehicle is facing uphill or reverse if it is facing downhill) and leave the wheels steered. On versions equipped with an Electric Drive Unit, put the PRND command on P before releasing the brake pedal stop the engine and apply the electric parking brake
- lock the vehicle
activate the anti-theft alarm system Block the wheels with a wedge or a stone if the car is parked on a steep slope. The engine cooling fans may run after the engine has been switched off
WARNING NEVER leave the car with the transmission in neutral (or, on versions with Electric Drive Unit before putting the PRND command in P).
WARNING In the event of an accident with airbag deployment, the engine is switched off automatically if the vehicle comes to a standstill within a certain time.
In countries with extremely low temperatures it may be necessary to park the vehicle without applied parking brake. Make sure to park the vehicle on a level surface.
## WARNING
158) Do not park the vehicle on an easily ignitable surface. The high temperature of the exhaust system could ignite the surface. Always apply the parking brake. If the vehicle is on a level surface or uphill slope, engage first gear or set the PRND command to position P. If the vehicle is on a downhill slope, engage reverse gear or set the PRND command to position P. Turn the front wheels towards the kerb. Close the windows. Switch off the engine. Remove the ignition key from the ignition switch or switch off ignition on vehicles with STOP START ENGINE button. Turn the steering wheel until the steering wheel lock is felt to engage. 159) Never leave children unattended in the vehicle. Always remove the ignition
key when leaving the vehicle and take it out with you.
## IMPORTANT
- 51) After running at high engine speeds or with high engine loads, operate the engine briefly at a low load or run in neutral for approx. 30 seconds before switching off, in order to protect the turbocharger.
## PARKING BRAKE
JJ000634
171
## MANUAL PARKING BRAKE
The parking brake lever is located between the front seats.
## Engaging the parking brake
Pull lever upwards until the car is secured. Four or five clicks are generally enough when the car is on level ground while ten or eleven may be required if
the car is on a steep slope and laden: if it is not so, contact a Jeep Dealership to have it adjusted.
## Releasing the parking brake
Slightly raise lever and hold button on top of the lever pressed, checking that the warning light switches off in the instrument panel.
## ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE
JJ000514
172
The electric parking brake can be engaged in two ways:
manually, by pulling the switch (1) fig. 172 on the central tunnel
automatically, when the vehicle is stationary and the ignition is switched off (Automatic Parking Brake)
## APPLYING WHEN VEHICLE IS STATIONARY
The electric parking brake can always be activated, even if the ignition is off. Do not operate electric parking brake system too often without engine running
as this will discharge the conventional battery.
## RELEASING
Switch on ignition. Keep foot brake pedal depressed and then push switch .
## DRIVE AWAY FUNCTION
Vehicles with manual transmission: Depressing the clutch pedal and then slightly releasing the clutch pedal and slightly depressing the accelerator pedal releases the electric parking brake automatically. This is only possible if the Automatic Parking Brake is activated. It is not possible when switch is pulled at the same time.
Vehicles with Electric Drive Unit: Engaging R, D or M and then depressing the accelerator pedal releases the electric parking brake automatically. This is only possible if the Automatic Parking Brake is activated. It is not possible when switch is pulled at the same time.
## BRAKING WHEN VEHICLE IS MOVING
When the vehicle is moving and the switch is kept pulled, the electric parking brake system will decelerate the vehicle. As soon as the switch is released, braking will be stopped. The antilock brake system and the Dynamic Stability Control stabilise the vehicle while the switch is
kept pulled. If an error of the electric parking brake occurs, a warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display. If the antilock brake system and the Dynamic Stability Control fail, indicator illuminates in the instrument panel display. In this case, stability during deceleration of the vehicle can only be maintained with repeated short pulls of the switch until the vehicle is immobilised.
## AUTOMATIC PARKING BRAKE
Automatic Parking Brake includes automatic application and automatic release of the electric parking brake. Automatic application:
The electric parking brake is automatically applied when the vehicle is stationary and the ignition is switched off.
illuminates in the instrument panel display and a display message pops up to confirm the application. Automatic release:
WARNING The automatic release of the electric parking brake is inhibited as long as the driver's door is open.
Parking brake releases automatically on driving off.
extinguishes in the instrument panel display and a display message pops up to confirm the release.

When clutch slip is detected for a specific time, the engine power will be reduced. A warning is displayed in the instrument panel display. Release the clutch.
## WARNING
- 162) Press the clutch pedal fully to shift gears correctly. It is therefore essential that there is nothing under the pedals: make sure the mats are lying flat and do not get in the way of the pedals.
- 163) Never leave children unattended in the vehicle. Always remove the ignition key when leaving the vehicle and take it out with you.
## IMPORTANT
52) Do not drive with your hand resting on the gear lever as the force exerted, even if slight, could lead over time to premature wear of the gearbox internal components.
## ELECTRIC DRIVE UNIT
(Electric versions)
163)
## OPERATION
174 JJ000460 The vehicle uses an Electric Drive Unit with a 1-gear transmission. Push the buttons fig. 174:
- P : park position, wheels are locked, engage only when the vehicle is stationary, engaged automatically when driver's door is opened or engine is switched off
- R : reverse gear, engage only when the vehicle is stationary
- N : neutral
- D : drive mode, low recuperation (first push)
- B : regenerative braking (second push) The mode is shown in the instrument panel display (1) fig. 175.
133
STARTING AND DRIVING
134
The state of the Electric Driving Unit remains displayed on the instrument panel for a few seconds after switching off the ignition.
## Park mode P
This mode locks the front wheels. It is the recommended mode when starting the propulsion system because the vehicle cannot move easily.
165) 166)
The electric drive unit automatically shifts to P if:
the vehicle is stopped
the driver's door is opened while the vehicle's speed is below 2 km/h
The vehicle will not shift into P if it is moving too fast. Stop the vehicle and shift into P.
To shift into P, press button P. The LED on the button turns on.
To shift out of P: Depress the brake pedal and select the desired mode.
## Reverse gear R
To shift into and out of R, the vehicle must be at standstill and the brake pedal has to be depressed.
With the reverse gear engaged, the LED on the button turns on.
## Neutral N
In this mode, the propulsion system does not transfer torque to the wheels. To restart the propulsion system when the vehicle is already moving, use D only. With the neutral engaged, the LED on the button turns on.
167)
## Drive mode D
With the D engaged, the LED on the button turns on.
WARNING In slippery conditions, operate the vehicle in D for enhanced riding and handling performance.
## Regenerative braking mode B
Regenerative braking generates electrical energy resulting from engine braking to charge the high-voltage battery. Regenerative power may be limited when the high-voltage battery is fully charged. If B mode is selected, energy is regenerated when the accelerator pedal is lifted. In this mode, vehicle speed is significantly reduced by releasing the
accelerator pedal, without operating the brake pedal.
Use B mode when driving down steep hills, in deep snow, in mud or in stopand-go traffic.
## 168) 169)
B can only be activated if D is selected. Press button B. The LED on the button turns on.
To deactivate B, press button B.
## Deactivating the automatic operation of P mode for electric vehicles
The procedure for the deactivation of the automatic operation of P mode also deactivates the automatic operation of the electric parking brake.
For this procedure, refer to the description of the automatic parking brake.
## WARNING
164) Never leave children unattended in the vehicle. Always remove the ignition key when leaving the vehicle and take it out with you.
- 165) Never use P mode instead of the electric parking brake. Always engage the electric parking brake when parking the car to avoid the accidental movement of the vehicle.
- 166) Do not leave the vehicle when the propulsion system is running, the vehicle may move suddenly. You or others can be
injured. To be sure the vehicle will not move, even if you are on even ground, make sure the parking brake is applied and P is selected.
- 167) Do not shift the Electric Drive Unit to N and do not stop the engine when driving on a downhill road. This type of driving is dangerous and reduces the possibility of intervening in the case of variation of the road traffic or surface. You risk losing control of your car and causing accidents.
- 168) In the case of extreme temperatures or if the high-voltage battery is almost fully charged, the brake force of the regenerative braking may be temporarily reduced. If the braking force is not sufficient, the driver has to be prepared to use the brake pedal.
- 169) While using regenerative braking, the brake lights do not illuminate. If the succeeding traffic is to be warned, depress the brake pedal.
## IMPORTANT
53) If the car is on a gradient, always engage the electric parking brake BEFORE placing the Electric Drive Unit in P.
54) Shifting into R while the vehicle is moving forward could damage the electric drive unit. Only shift into R after the vehicle has been stopped.
- 55) If the vehicle seems to accelerate slowly or not respond when you try to go faster, do not continue your journey. The electric drive unit could be damaged.
Consult a Jeep Dealership as soon as possible.
56) Spinning the tyres or holding the vehicle in one place on a hill using only the accelerator pedal may damage the electric drive unit. If you are stuck, do not spin the tyres. When stopping on a hill, use the brakes to hold the vehicle in place.
## SELEC-TERRAIN
(where provided)
170) 171)
Each drive mode corresponds to a different vehicle setting.
176 JJ000517 To select the respective drive mode, use the toggle switch (1) fig. 176. Push the button or for selecting the requested mode and wait 2 seconds after release for confirmation. The list of the modes is show on the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV display.
## Normal mode
The settings in this mode are set by default. Everytime the ignition is switched on, this mode is selected. Electric vehicle: To optimise range, electric engine power output is reduced.
## Sport mode
With a manual gearbox: to obtain more dynamic driving with action on the power steering, accelerator and the possibility of displaying the vehicle's dynamic settings on the instrument panel. With an Electric Drive Unit: to obtain more dynamic driving with action on the power steering, accelerator, gear changes, displaying the vehicle's dynamic settings on the instrument panel (depending on version) and activation/ deactivation of the display colour (depending on version).
## Eco mode
Reduces fuel consumption by optimising the operation of the heating and air conditioning and, depending on version, the accelerator pedal.
Electric vehicle: To optimise range, electric engine power output is reduced and heating is switched off.
## Sand mode
This mode allows little spin on the two driving wheels at the same time to allow the vehicle to move forward and limit the risks of getting stuck in the sand (mode active up to 120 km/h (75 mph)).
135
STARTING AND DRIVING
136
## Mud mode
This mode, when moving off, allows considerable spin on the wheel with the least grip to optimise clearing of the mud and to regain grip. At the same time, the wheel with the most grip is controlled in such a way as to transmit as much traction torque as possible.
When moving, the system optimises wheel spin to respond to the driver's requirements as fully as possible (mode active up to 50 km/h (31 mph)).
## Snow mode
This mode constantly adapts the level of wheel spin to offer maximum traction according to the snow conditions (a lot of wheel spin in thick snow; very little on ice). The wheel spin is also adapted to the conditions encountered when driving uphill by optimising the acceleration of the vehicle (mode active up to 80 km/h (50 mph)).
## Recommendations
The vehicle is designed principally to drive on tarmac roads, but it may occasionally drive on other less passable terrain. However, it does not permit off-road driving:
Driving on terrain that can damage the underbody or tear off elements (e.g. fuel pipe, fuel cooler) by obstacles or stones in particular
Driving on terrain with steep gradients and poor grip
- Crossing a waterway
## WARNING
- 170) For optimum grip on snow, it is recommended that you fit the vehicle with winter tyres. For optimum system performance, contact a Jeep Dealership to choose the most suitable tyres.
- 171) Your driving style must always be suited to the road conditions, visibility and traffic. The driver is, in any case, responsible for safe driving.
- 172) Do not use the other modes on sand as the vehicle may become stuck.
## STOP-START SYSTEM
(where provided)
The Stop-Start system helps to save fuel and to reduce the exhaust emissions. When conditions allow, it switches off the engine as soon as the vehicle is at a low speed or at a standstill, e.g. at a traffic light or in a traffic jam.
## Activation/deactivation
The Stop-Start system is available as soon as the engine is started, the vehicle starts-off and the conditions as stated below in this section are fulfilled.
The deactivation and reactivation of the Stop-Start system can be done through the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV settings.
## AUTOSTOP
Activate an Autostop as follows: Set the selector lever to neutral.
- Release the clutch pedal.
The engine will be switched off while the ignition stays on.
## Indication
JJ000184
177 An Autostop is indicated by control indicator .
During an Autostop, the heating and brake performance will be maintained.
## Conditions for an Autostop
The Stop-Start system checks if each of the following conditions is fulfilled. The Stop-Start system is not manually deactivated.
The driver's door is closed or the driver's seat belt is fastened.
- The conventional battery is sufficiently charged and in good condition.
- The engine is warmed up.
- The engine coolant temperature is not too high.
- The engine exhaust temperature is not too high, e.g. after driving with high engine load.
- The ambient temperature is not too low or too high.
- The climate control system allows an Autostop.
- The brake vacuum is sufficient.
- The self-cleaning function of the exhaust filter is not active.
- The vehicle was driven at least at walking speed since the last Autostop. Autostop will be inhibited if these conditions are not met. In addition, Autostop may be inhibited
- by certain settings of the climate control system
- immediately after higher speed driving
- in the case of new vehicle running-in
- by active demisting
- in the case of steep ascending or descending slopes
WARNING The Autostop may be inhibited for several hours after a conventional battery replacement or reconnection.
## Conventional battery discharge protection
To ensure reliable engine restarts, several conventional battery discharge protection features are implemented as part of the Stop-Start system.
## Power saving measures
During an Autostop, several electrical features such as auxiliary electric heater or rear window heating are disabled or switched to a power saving mode. The fan speed of the climate control system is reduced to save power.
## RESTART OF THE ENGINE BY THE DRIVER
Depress the clutch pedal without depressing the brake pedal to restart the engine.
## RESTART OF THE ENGINE BY THE STOP-START SYSTEM
The selector lever must be in neutral to enable an automatic restart.
If one of the following conditions occurs during an Autostop, the engine will be restarted automatically by the Stop-Start system:
- Stop-Start system manually deactivated
- driver's seat belt unfastened and driver's door opened
- engine temperature too low
- charging level of conventional battery below a defined level
- brake vacuum not sufficient
- vehicle is driven or rolls at least at walking speed
- climate control system requests engine start
- air conditioning manually switched on
- the bonnet is opened
If an electrical accessory, e.g. a portable CD player, is connected to the power outlet, a brief power drop during the restart might be noticeable.
## ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS (ADAS) RECOMMENDATIONS
178
## JJ000467
NOTE Ensure that the units of speed displayed in the instrument panel (mph or km/h) are those for the country you are driving in. If this is not the case, when the vehicle is stationary, set the display to the required units of speed so that it complies with what is authorised locally. In case of doubt, contact a Jeep Dealership.
## WARNING
173) Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) are developed to support the driver and not to replace the driver's attention. The driver accepts full responsibility when driving the vehicle. Driving and manoeuvring aids cannot, in
137
STARTING AND DRIVING
138
- any circumstances, replace the need for vigilance on the part of the driver. The driver must comply with the Highway Code, must remain in control of the vehicle in all circumstances and must be able to retake control of it at all times. The driver must adapt the speed to climatic conditions, traffic and the state of the road. It is the driver's responsibility to constantly monitor traffic conditions, assess the distance and relative speed of other vehicles, and anticipate their manoeuvres before using the direction indicator and changing lanes. These systems do not make it possible to exceed the laws of physics.
- 174) You should hold the steering wheel with both hands, always use the door and interior mirrors, always leave your feet close to the pedals and take a break every 2 hours.
- 175) The driver must always check the surroundings of the vehicle before and during the whole manoeuvre, in particular using the mirrors.
- 176) The usage of a license plate support on the front bumper may affect the proper radar unit functionality. When using a license plate support, follow the markings and indications on the front bumper
- 177) The use of mats or pedals covers not approved by Jeep may interfere with the operation of the speed limiter or cruise control. To avoid any risk of jamming the pedals ensure that the mat is secured correctly and never fit one mat on top of another.
## IMPORTANT
- 57) The operation of the radar(s), along with any associated functions, may be affected by the accumulation of dirt (e.g. mud, ice), in poor weather conditions (e.g. heavy rain, snow), or if the bumpers are damaged. If the front bumper is to be repainted, contact a Jeep Dealership; certain types of paint could interfere with the operation of the radar(s).
- 58) This camera and its associated functions may be impaired or not work if the windscreen area in front of the camera is dirty, misty, frosty, covered with snow, damaged or masked by a sticker. In humid and cold weather, demist the windscreen regularly. Poor visibility (inadequate street lighting, heavy rain, thick fog, snowfall), dazzle (headlamps of an oncoming vehicle, low sun, reflections on a damp road, leaving a tunnel, alternating shade and light) can also impair detection performance. In the event of a windscreen replacement, contact a Jeep Dealership to recalibrate the camera; otherwise, the operation of the associated driving aids may be disrupted.
- 59) The images from the camera(s) displayed on the touch screen or on the instrument panel may be distorted by the terrain. In the presence of areas in shade, or in conditions of bright sunlight or inadequate lighting, the image may be darkened and with lower contrast. Obstacles may appear further away than they actually are.
- 60) The operation of the sensors, as well as any associated functions, may be disrupted by noise pollution such as that emitted by noisy vehicles and machinery (e.g. lorries, pneumatic drills), by the accumulation of snow or dead leaves on the road or in the event of damaged bumpers and mirrors. When reverse gear is engaged, an audible signal (long beep) indicates that the sensors may be dirty. A front or rear impact to the vehicle can upset the sensors' settings, which is not always detected by the system: distance measurements may be distorted. The sensors do not systematically detect obstacles that are too low (pavements, studs) or too thin (trees, posts, wire fences). Certain obstacles located in the sensors' blind spots may not be detected or may no longer be detected during the manoeuvre. Certain materials (fabrics) absorb sound waves: pedestrians may not be detected.
- 61) Clean the bumpers and door mirrors and the field of vision of the cameras regularly. When washing your vehicle at high pressure, direct the spray from at least 30 cm away from the radar, sensors and cameras.
## SHORTCUTS FOR ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS
Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) can be accessed directly to quickly activate/deactivate them. By default, driving aids are already stored in the system (e.g. Stop-Start, Lane Keeping Assist) Other driving aids can be added or deleted from the page. It is configured in the "ADAS"&gt;"Functions" touch screen application.

## OFF
Press (3): the cruise control information display disappears.
## MALFUNCTION
In the event of a malfunction, dashes are displayed flashing and then fixed (orange) instead of the speed setting. Have it checked by a Jeep Dealership.
## WARNING
181) The cruise control function does not guarantee compliance with the maximum authorised speed and the safety distance between vehicles, the driver remains responsible for their driving. In the interest of public safety, only use cruise control if the traffic conditions enable vehicles to drive at a steady speed and maintain an adequate safety distance. Remain vigilant while cruise control is activated. If you press and hold one of the speed setting modification buttons, your vehicle may change speed very abruptly. When descending a steep hill, the cruise control system cannot prevent the vehicle from exceeding the set speed. Brake if necessary to control the vehicle speed. On steep climbs or when towing, the set speed may not be reached or maintained. 182) Never use the system in the following situations: in an urban area with the risk of pedestrians crossing the road; in heavy traffic (except versions with the Stop &amp; Go function); on winding or steep roads; on slippery or flooded roads; in poor weather conditions; in the event of restricted visibility for the driver; driving
on a speed circuit; driving on a rolling road; when using a "space-saver" type spare wheel; when using snow chains, non-slip covers or studded tyres.

WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in this section and "System limits" in this chapter.
The Adaptive cruise control is an enhancement of the cruise control with the additional feature of maintaining a certain following distance to the vehicle ahead.
NOTE Primarily designed for driving on main roads and motorways, this system only works with moving vehicles driving in the same direction as your vehicle.
It uses radar and camera sensors to detect the vehicles ahead fig. 184. If no vehicle is detected in the driving path, the Adaptive cruise control will behave like a conventional cruise control.
## 184
JJ000467
The Adaptive cruise control automatically decelerates the vehicle when approaching a slower moving vehicle. It then adjusts the vehicle speed to follow the vehicle ahead at the selected following distance. The vehicle speed increases or decreases to follow the vehicle ahead, but will not exceed the set speed. It may apply limited braking with activated brake lights.
If the vehicle ahead accelerates or changes lane, the Adaptive cruise control progressively accelerates the vehicle to return to the stored set speed. If the driver operates the turn lights to overtake a slower vehicle, the Adaptive cruise control allows the vehicle to temporarily approach the vehicle ahead to help passing it. However, the set speed will never be exceeded.
The Adaptive cruise control can store set speeds over 30 km/h for manual transmission. If the vehicle ahead is moving too slowly and the selected following distance cannot be maintained
anymore, a warning chime is given and a message is displayed in the instrument panel display. The message prompts the driver to take back control of the vehicle. On vehicles with Electric Drive Unit, the system can brake the vehicle until a full stop. Depending on variant, the system can automatically accelerate the vehicle after a full stop.

## ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP&amp;GO FUNCTION
For full Electric vehicles, Adaptive cruise control allows to maintain the selected distance behind a braking vehicle until a complete stop is reached.
If the system has stopped your vehicle behind another vehicle, next to the set speed is shown the symbol . This symbol notifies, that the vehicle is hold automatically in stop position.
While the vehicle is hold in stop position, the following recommendations should be followed:
- do not leave the vehicle
- do not open the load compartment do not engage the reverse gear
do not drop off or pick up passengers Within three seconds after the vehicle has been stopped by the system, the vehicle slowly moves again. After three seconds, accelerate or press button (4) to drive away. Pay attention to the
surroundings of the vehicle when driving away.
If the vehicle stays stopped for more than 5 minutes or if the driver's door is opened and the driver's seat belt is unfastened, then the electric parking brake is applied automatically to hold the vehicle. The symbol will illuminate. To release electric parking brake, press the accelerator pedal.
193)
## DRIVER'S ATTENTION
Use the Adaptive cruise control carefully on bends or mountain roads, as it can lose the vehicle ahead and needs time to detect it again
do not use the system on slippery roads as it can create rapid changes in tyre traction (wheel spinning), so that you could lose control of the vehicle do not use the Adaptive cruise control during rain, snow or heavy dirt, as the radar sensor can be covered by a water film, dust, ice or snow. This reduce or suppresses completely the visibility. In case of sensor blockage, clean the sensor cover
do not use the system when the spare wheel is in use
## SYSTEM LIMITS
194)
After a sudden lane change, the system needs a certain time to detect the next preceding vehicle. So if a new
vehicle is detected, the system may accelerate instead of braking.
- The Adaptive cruise control does ignore the oncoming traffic.
- The Adaptive cruise control does not consider pedestrians and animals for braking and driving off.
- The Adaptive cruise control considers stopped vehicles only at low speed.
- Do not use the Adaptive cruise control when towing a trailer.
Do not use the Adaptive cruise control on roads with an incline of more than 10%.
As the radar's field of detection is quite narrow, it is possible that the system may not detect:
vehicles of reduced width, e.g. motorcycles, scooters fig. 187
187
JJ000628
vehicles not running in the middle of the lane fig. 188
145
STARTING AND DRIVING
146
188
JJ000625
vehicles entering a corner vehicles suddenly pulling out Deactivate the system in the following situations:
when driving in a tight bend fig. 189 when approaching a roundabout when following a vehicle not detected by system, e.g., a motorcycle when the vehicle ahead sharply decelerates
190
JJ000629
when a vehicle cuts in sharply between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead fig. 190
## Hill considerations
191 195)
JJ000194
System performance on hills depends on vehicle speed, vehicle load, traffic conditions and the road gradient. It may not detect a vehicle in your path while driving on hills. On steep hills, you may have to use the accelerator pedal to maintain your vehicle speed.
When going downhill you may have to brake to maintain or reduce your speed. Note that applying the brake deactivates the system.
## RADAR UNIT
192 JJ000387 The radar unit is located in the middle of the front bumper (fig. 192).
196) 197)
## FAULT
In the event of an Adaptive cruise control fault, a warning light is illuminated in the instrument panel display and a warning message is displayed in the instrument panel display accompanied by an audible signal.
The speed limit recognition may not operate correctly if traffic signs do not comply with the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. Have the system checked by a Jeep Dealership. As a safety measure, do not use the system if the brake lights are faulty. Do not use the system if the front bumper is damaged.
## WARNING
- 183) Pay the utmost attention while driving at all times and be always ready to press the brakes if needed.
- 184) The system is an aid for the driver, who must always pay full attention while driving. The responsibility always rests with the driver, who must take into account the traffic conditions in order to drive in complete safety. The driver must always maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
- 185) The device is not activated in presence of pedestrians, oncoming vehicles in the opposite direction of travel or moving in the crosswise direction and stationary objects (e.g. a vehicle standing in a queue or a broken down vehicle).
- 186) The device cannot take account of road, traffic and weather conditions and conditions of poor visibility (e.g. fog).
- 187) The device does not always fully recognise complicated driving conditions which could cause incorrect or non-existing determination of the safe distance to be held.
- 188) The device cannot apply the maximum braking force: the car will not be stopped completely.
- 189) The radar is provided with defrosting system. For this reason, it can reach high temperatures in some conditions. If you need to operate in the zone surrounding the sensor, wait for at least 30 seconds from when the engine is switched off.
- 190) If any of the following malfunctions occurs, do not use the system: following an impact on the windscreen close to the
- camera or on the front bumper; in case of a brake lamp failure.
- 191) If the vehicle has undergone any of the following modifications, do not use the system: carrying long objects on roof bars; towing; front end of the vehicle modified (for example by adding longrange headlamps or painting the front bumper); obstructed radar.
- 192) The complete driver attention is always required while driving with adaptive cruise control. The driver stays fully in control of the vehicle because the brake pedal, the accelerator pedal and the button have priority over any adaptive cruise control operation.
- 193) When the system is deactivated or cancelled, the vehicle will no longer be held at a stop and can start moving. Be always prepared to manually apply the brake to hold the vehicle stationary. Do not leave the vehicle while it is being held at a stop by adaptive cruise control. Always move the PRND command to park position P and switch off the ignition before leaving the vehicle.
- 194) The system's automatic brake force does not permit hard braking and the braking level may not be sufficient to avoid a collision.
- 195) Do not use the adaptive cruise control on steep hill roads.
- 196) The radar unit was aligned carefully during manufacture. Therefore, in the event of a frontend impact, do not use the system. The front bumper may appear to be intact, however the sensor behind may be affected and react incorrectly. After an accident, consult a Jeep Dealership to verify and adjust the radar unit position.
- 197) The usage of a license plate support on the front bumper may affect the proper radar unit functionality. When using a license plate support, follow the markings and indications on the front bumper.
## IMPORTANT
- 62) The system may have limited operation or not work at all in weather conditions such as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow.
- 63) The section of the bumper area in front the sensor or the radar sensor itself must not be covered with stickers, auxiliary headlights or any other object.
- 64) Operation can be adversely affected by any structural change made to the vehicle, such as a modification to the front geometry, tyre change, or a heavier than standard load of the vehicle.
- 65) Incorrect repairs made on the front part of the car (e.g. bumper, chassis) may alter the position of the radar sensor, and adversely affect its operation. Go to a Jeep Dealership for any operation of this type.
- 66) Do not tamper with or carry out any intervention on the radar sensor or on the camera on the windscreen glass. In the event of a sensor failure, contact a Jeep Dealership.
- 67) Do not wash with high-pressure jets in the bumper lower area: in particular do not operate on the system's electrical connector. Do not use solvents or abrasive paste.
- 68) Be careful in case of repairs and painting in the zone around the sensor. In
147
STARTING AND DRIVING
148
the event of a frontal impact the sensor may automatically deactivate and display a warning to indicate that the sensor needs to be repaired. Even without a malfunction warning, deactivate the system operation if you think that the position of the radar sensor has changed (e.g. due to low-speed frontal impact as during parking manoeuvres). In these cases, go to a Jeep Dealership to have the radar sensor realigned or replaced. 69) The brake lamps come on if the vehicle is slowed down by the system. The system is not operational in the event of a brake lamp failure.
## LANE KEEPING ASSIST
(where provided)
198) 199)
70) 71) 72) 73) 74) 75)
WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in this section.
Lane Keeping Assist supports the driver to avoid unintended leaving of the lane. The front camera observes road edges, as well as the lane markings between which the vehicle is driving. If the vehicle approaches a road edge or a lane marking, the steering wheel is gently turned so that the vehicle turns back into the lane. Turn steering wheel in same direction, if the system does not steer sufficiently. Turn steering wheel gently
into opposite direction, if lane change is intended.
When the system steers to correct the trajectory of the vehicle, flashes yellow in the instrument panel display. Unintended lane departure is not assumed by the system when the turn lights are operated and during few seconds after turn lights have been switched off.
If the system detects that the steering wheel is not held permanently, it interrupts the correction. A warning message in the instrument panel display accompanied by a warning chime alerts when immediate driver's action is required.
WARNING The system may be switched off if it detects lanes which are too narrow, too wide or too curved.
Following preconditions have to be fulfilled:
vehicle speed must be between approximately 70 km/h and 180 km/h the driver must hold the steering wheel the turn lights are not activated the electronic stability control is activated and not in operation the vehicle is not connected to a trailer or a bicycle carrier normal driving behaviour (system detects dynamic driving style, i.e. pressure on the brake or accelerator pedal)
roads with good lane markings no spare wheel is used the vehicle is not driven in a tight corner
## ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION
This system can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
## FAULT
In the event of a fault, and appear in the instrument panel, accompanied by a display message and a warning chime. Seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership.
## SYSTEM LIMITATIONS
The system performance may be affected by:
a dirty or foggy windscreen or if the windscreen is affected by foreign objects, e.g. stickers
close vehicles ahead
- banked roads
- winding or hilly roads
- road edges
- sudden lighting changes
- adverse environmental conditions, e.g. heavy rain or snow
vehicle modifications, e.g. tyres Switch off the system if the system is disturbed by tar marks, shadows, road cracks, temporary or construction lane markings, or other road imperfections.
## WARNING
- 198) Always keep your attention on the road and maintain proper vehicle position within the lane, otherwise vehicle damage, injury or death could occur. Lane Keeping Assist does not continuously steer the vehicle. The system may not keep the vehicle in the lane or give an alert, even if a lane marking is detected. The steering of the Lane Keeping Assist may not be sufficient to avoid a lane departure. The system may not detect handsoff driving due to external influences like road condition and surface and weather. The driver has full responsibility to control the vehicle and is always required to keep the hands on the steering wheel while driving. Using the system on slippery roads could cause loss of control of the vehicle and a crash. Switch the system off.
- 199) If the vehicle is connected to a trailer or a bicycle carrier, the system is deactivated automatically.
## IMPORTANT
- 70) The camera may have limited or absent operation due to weather conditions such as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow, formation of ice layers on the windscreen glass.
- 71) Camera operation may also be compromised by the presence of dust, condensation, dirt or ice on the windscreen glass, by traffic conditions (e.g. cars that are driving not aligned
with yours, car driving in a transverse or opposite way on the same lane, bend with a small radius of curvature), by road surface conditions and by driving conditions (e.g. off-road driving). Make sure the windscreen is always clean. Use specific detergents and clean cloths to avoid scratching the windscreen. The camera operation may also be limited or absent in some driving, traffic and road surface conditions.
- 72) Projecting loads on the roof of the car may interfere with the correct operation of the camera. Before starting make sure the load is correctly positioned, in order not to cover the camera operating range.
- 73) If the windscreen glass must be replaced due to scratches, chipping or breakage, contact exclusively a Jeep Dealership. Do not replace the windscreen on your own, risk of malfunction! It is advisable to replace the windscreen if it is damaged in the area of the camera.
- 74) Do not tamper with nor operate on the camera. Do not close the openings in the aesthetic cover located under the interior rear view mirror. In the event of a failure of the camera, contact a Jeep Dealership. 75) Do not cover the operating range of the camera with stickers or other objects. Also pay attention to other objects on the bonnet (e.g. a layer of snow) and make sure they do not interfere with the camera.

WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in this section and "System limitations" in this chapter.
Advanced lane keep assist is an enhancement of the lane keep assist system.
193 JJ000352 The activated system observes the lane markings by using the camera located at the top of the windscreen, fig. 193. It steers the vehicle inside the detected lane. The driver will notice a turning movement of the steering wheel.
149
STARTING AND DRIVING
150
194 JJ000225 Thus, the current position of the vehicle within the lane is kept. This position is not necessarily the centre of the lane. In the case that the vehicle is driving at the outer edge of the lane, the system corrects the trajectory smoothly towards the centre of the currently driven lane when a determined speed has been exceeded. Again, the driver will notice a turning movement of the steering wheel. When the vehicle is steered by the system, illuminates green in the instrument panel display.
However, the control of the vehicle can be taken over at any time by the driver. Therefore, the driver needs to apply some additional force when turning the steering wheel
If the system detects that the driver is not holding the wheel firmly enough, it triggers a series of gradual alerts. If the interruption takes too long, the system will be deactivated. extinguishes in the instrument panel display. The system has to be reactivated again by the driver. Advanced lane keep assist operates only in combination with adaptive cruise control.
## Required preconditions
- Adaptive cruise control with Stop&amp;Go must be activated.
- The driver must hold the steering wheel.
- The turn lights are not activated.
- The Electronic Stability Control is activated and not in operation.
- The vehicle is not connected to a trailer or a bicycle carrier.
- Normal driving behaviour is required (system detects dynamic driving style, i.e. pressure on the brake or accelerator pedal).
- Roads with good lane markings are required.
- No spare wheel is used.
- The vehicle is not driven in a tight corner.
## Activation/deactivation
This system can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
## Pausing / suspending the system
Advanced lane keep assist may be paused or suspended in the following situations:
- The Electronic Stability Control is in operation or it has been deactivated.
- At least one of the lane markings is not detected by the system for several seconds. The system will be reactivated
- once the operating conditions are regained.
- The turn lights are activated.
- Driving outside the lane limits.
- The steering wheel is held too tight or moved too dynamically.
- The brake pedal or the accelerator pedal are applied.
- The adaptive cruise control is paused.
- The road is too narrow or wide.
- The lateral acceleration in curves is too high
Pausing the system is accompanied by a specific audible signal.
If the system detects that the driver is not holding the wheel firmly enough, it triggers a series of gradual alerts and then deactivates itself if there is no response from the driver.
If the function is suspended due to the prolonged release of the force holding the steering wheel, the system must be reactivated by pressing the (1) fig. 195 button.

Deactivate the system if the system is disturbed by tar marks, shadows, road cracks, temporary or construction lane markings, or other road imperfections.
202) 203)
## WARNING
- 200) The system assists the driver in managing the steering, acceleration and braking within the limits of the laws of physics and the capabilities of the vehicle. Some road infrastructure elements or vehicles present on the road may not be properly seen or may be poorly interpreted by the camera and radar, which may lead to an unexpected change in direction, a lack of steering correction and/or inappropriate management of the acceleration or braking.
- 201) The driver must act promptly if they believe that the traffic conditions or the state of the road surface require their intervention, by moving the steering wheel to temporarily suspend system operation. Any intervention on the brake pedal that causes the Adaptive cruise control to pause will also cause the system to pause.
202) Always keep your attention on the road and maintain proper vehicle position within the lane, otherwise vehicle damage, injury or death could occur. The system may not keep the vehicle in the lane or give an alert, even if a lane marking is detected. The steering of the advanced lane keep assist may not be sufficient to avoid a lane departure. The system may not detect handsoff driving due to external influences (road condition and surface, weather etc). The driver has full responsibility to control the vehicle and is always required to keep the hands on the steering wheel while driving. Using the system while towing a trailer or on slippery roads could cause loss of control
of the vehicle and a crash. Switch the system off.
- 203) The system should be deactivated in the following situations: when changing a wheel or working near a wheel; towing or with a bicycle carrier on a towing device, especially with trailer not plugged in or not approved; adverse weather conditions; road with low grip (risk of aquaplaning, snow, ice); road works and toll areas; driving on racing circuits; driving on a rolling road.
## IMPORTANT
- 76) The camera may have limited or absent operation due to weather conditions such as: heavy rain, hail, thick fog, heavy snow, formation of ice layers on the windscreen glass.
- 77) Camera operation may also be compromised by the presence of dust, condensation, dirt or ice on the windscreen glass, by traffic conditions (e.g. cars that are driving not aligned with yours, car driving in a transverse or opposite way on the same lane, bend with a small radius of curvature), by road surface conditions and by driving conditions (e.g. off-road driving). Make sure the windscreen is always clean. Use specific detergents and clean cloths to avoid scratching the windscreen. The camera operation may also be limited or absent in some driving, traffic and road surface conditions.
- 78) Projecting loads on the roof of the car may interfere with the correct operation of the camera. Before starting make sure the
151

WARNING For more information, refer to the "Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) recommendations" chapter in this section and "System limitations" in this chapter.
Depending on the vehicle features, the Speed Limit Recognition uses the camera at the top of the windscreen (Traffic Sign Recognition) or the camera combined with the navigation system of Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
## TRAFFIC SIGN RECOGNITION
Using the camera at the top of the windscreen, this system detects and reads speed limit signs and end of speed limit signs.
If the function is activated and set as a widget in the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV , up to two speed limit signs including supplementary signs are displayed in the instrument panel display (1) fig. 196 (example for version 7").
If several speed limits are recognised, the vehicle may analyse and display the valid speed limit.
When a traffic sign for a certain area, e.g. city or motorway, is recognised and the vehicle is fitted with a navigation system, the corresponding speed limit will also be displayed.
If the system is activated but does not detect a speed limit sign, the following sign is displayed:
197
If a speed limit is detected and the vehicle exceeds it for the first time
JJ000631
by more than 5 km/h, the speed is displayed and flashes about 10 seconds. This system can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
NOTE Specific speed limits, such as those for heavy goods vehicles, are not displayed. The display of the speed limit on the instrument panel is updated when passing a speed limit sign intended for cars (light vehicles).
## SPEED LIMIT RECOGNITION WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM
(for versions/markets where provided) Depending on version, two different systems are available.
## Version 1
Using the camera at the top of the windscreen and the vehicle's integrated navigation system, this system provides speed limits and end of speed limits. If the function is activated and set as a widget in the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV , up to two speed limit signs including supplementary signs are displayed (1) fig. 198 (example for version 7").
This system can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
If the system is activated but does not detect a speed limit sign, the following sign is displayed:
199 JJ000631 If a speed limit is detected and the vehicle exceeds it for the first time by more than 5 km/h, the speed is displayed and flashes about 10 seconds.
## Updating navigation map data
To maintain the performance of the system, the navigation map should be kept updated via "Over-The-Air map updates". Further information are available in the paragraph "TomTom Services" in the "Multimedia" section.
## Version 2
This system displays permanently speed limit information in the instrument panel display. If the function is activated and set as a widget in the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV , up to two speed limit signs including supplementary signs are displayed (1) fig. 198 (example for version 7").
Providing the speed limit information involves the following systems:
camera at the top of the windscreen vehicle's integrated navigation system telematics service
If travelling on a road with no speed restrictions, e.g., on German motorways,
153
STARTING AND DRIVING

the following sign is displayed:
200 JJ000729 If the system is activated but does not detect a speed limit sign, the following sign is displayed:
201 JJ000631 If a new speed limit is provided, a confirmation chime is given. The confirmation chime can be activated or deactivated in the vehicle personalisation through the Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
If the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, the speed limit displayed in
the instrument panel display flashes and an audible signal is given after some time. Time of occurrence varies.
Both flashing and audible signal are terminated after a few seconds. Due to legal requirements, the audible signal can only be deactivated in the vehicle personalisation until the next time the ignition is switched on. If the audible signal is deactivated, illuminates for a few seconds.
In case of a failure, illuminates permanently. Seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership.
## Operation conditions
To provide country-specific speed limit information, the vehicle needs to identify the country it is currently in. If a corresponding country list is available in the instrument panel display, the respective country has to be selected manually. Otherwise, the country is automatically selected.
To get valid speed limit information, the vehicle's current position is sent via the telematics unit and is immediately deleted after processing. Tracking of the vehicle position is not possible at any time.
This is not impacted by the privacy settings of Uconnect™ 10,25"/10,25" NAV .
WARNING It is possible to report a permanent speed limit misinformation through the Jeep website.
## Updating data
To maintain the performance of the system, the navigation map should be kept updated via "Over-The-Air map updates". Further information are available in the paragraph "TomTom Services" in the "Multimedia" section.
## OTHER TRAFFIC SIGNS
The system recognises other traffic signs (shared traffic zones, supplementary traffic signs) and displays them in the instrument panel display.
## Entry into a shared traffic zone
Example:
## Speed limit when raining
Example:
## Speed limit when towing
Suggested speed (calculated): 10 mph or 20 km/h (depending on the units on the instrument panel)
If the wiper control stalk is in the "intermittent wipe" or "automatic wipe" position (in order to activate the rain sensor): 110 km/h (68 mph) (for example)
If an approved towing device is fixed to the vehicle: 90 km/h (56 mph) (for example)
## Speed limit applicable over a certain distance
Example:
## Speed limit for vehicles with a gross vehicle weight or gross train weight less than 3.5 tonnes
## Speed limit in case of snow
Example:
## Speed limit at certain times of the day
Example:
70 km/h (43 mph) (for example)

IMPORTANT
- 82) The system is intended to help the driver within a defined speed range to discern certain traffic signs. Do not ignore traffic signs which are not displayed by the system. The system does not discern any other than the conventional traffic signs that might give or end a speed limit. Do not let this special feature tempt you into taking risks when driving. Always adapt speed to the road conditions. The driver assistance systems do not relieve the driver from full responsibility for vehicle operation.
- 83) Functionality may be limited or the system may not work if the sensor is obstructed.
- 84) The system may have limited operation or not work at all in weather conditions, such as heavy rain, hail, thick fog and low temperatures. Strong light contrasts can influence the recognition capability of the sensor.
- 85) The area surrounding the sensor must not be covered with stickers or any other object.
- 86) Do not tamper or perform any operations in the area of the windscreen glass directly surrounding the sensor.
- 87) Clean the windscreen glass from foreign matters such as bird droppings, insects, snow or ice. Use specific detergents and clean cloths to avoid scratching the windscreen.
- 88) The units for the speed limit (mph or km/h) depend on the country you are driving in. This should be taken into account to ensure you observe the speed limit. For the system to work properly
when changing countries, the speed unit of the instrument panel must match that of the country you are driving in. 89) Automatic sign reading is a driving aid system and does not always display the correct speed limits. The speed limit signs present on the road always take priority over those displayed by the system. The system is designed to detect signs that conform to the Vienna Convention on road signs.
## HIGHWAY DRIVER ASSIST (LEVEL 2 AUTONOMOUS DRIVING)
(where provided)

221 JJ000698 Charging the vehicle's high-voltage battery depends upon several factors:
- high-voltage battery of the vehicle
external charging device charging cable
- internal onboard charger (OBC)
The charging cable connects the vehicle's high-voltage battery with an external charging device providing electric power. This may be a wall box or a public charging station.
The high-voltage battery can be charged with direct current (DC) only. When charging from a wall box or an alternating current (AC) charging station, AC has to be converted into DC. This is done by the vehicle's onboard charger. The onboard charger (where provided) is available with 7.4 kW (single-phase) and 11 kW (3-phase) (for versions/markets, where provided).
If the vehicle is charged at a public DC charging station, no DC conversion is required. The high-voltage battery can be directly charged with DC provided by the DC charging station.
The speed of charging of the vehicle's high-voltage battery depends upon the weakest element of the charging chain. To achieve the maximum charging speed, charging cable and charging device have to be attuned to each other.
WARNING Make sure that the charging cable used fits to the vehicle's onboard charger.
## CHARGING PORT ON THE CAR
To access the charging port, open the charging flap fig. 222 on the left side by pressing the area indicated by the arrow.

## DRIVING HINTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
## CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE
## Never coast with engine not running
Many systems will not function in this situation (e.g. brake servo unit, power steering). Driving in this manner is a danger to yourself and others. All systems function during an Autostop.
## Pedals
To ensure the pedal travel is uninhibited, there must be no mats in the area of the pedals.
Use only floor mats, which fit properly and are fixed by the retainers on the driver side.
## ON FLOODED ROADS
It's strongly advised against driving on flooded roads, as this could cause serious damage to the electric motor (Electric versions), the gearbox and the electrical systems of the vehicle.
If the vehicle absolutely must drive through a flooded section of road:
- check that the depth of the water does not exceed 23 cm, taking account of waves that might be generated by other users
- deactivate the Stop-Start function (where provided)
- drive as slowly as possible without stalling. In all cases, do not exceed 6 mph (10 km/h)
- do not stop and do not switch off the engine
On leaving the flooded road, as soon as safety conditions allow, make several light brake applications to dry the brake discs and pads.
If in doubt about the state of your vehicle, contact a Jeep dealership.
## STEERING
If power steering assist is lost because the engine stops or due to a system malfunction, the vehicle can be steered but may require increased effort.
## EMERGENCIES
252)
## ENERGY/FUEL CONSUMPTION REDUCTION
Below are some useful tips that allow you to achieve a reduction in energy consumption of the high-voltage battery and a consequent increase in range (for electric versions) and save fuel and thus lower the amount of harmful emissions
released into the atmosphere (for petrol versions).
## Car maintenance
Have your vehicle serviced regularly (e.g. engine oil, oil filter, air filter, passenger compartment filter, etc.). Checks and operations should be carried out in accordance with the "Service information" (see the "Maintenance and care" chapter).
## Tyres
Check the tyre pressures at least once every four weeks: if the pressure is too low, electrical energy or fuel consumption levels increase as resistance to rolling is higher.
In addition, carry out this check before a long journey, at each change of season and after a long period out of use.
Do not forget the spare wheel and, where applicable, the tyres on your trailer or caravan.
At the end of winter, remove snow tyres and refit summer tyres.
## Unnecessary loads
Do not travel with an overloaded luggage compartment. The weight of the car and its trim greatly affect electrical energy or fuel consumption and stability.
## Loads placement
Spread loads throughout the vehicle. Place the heaviest items in the boot as close as possible to the rear seats.
## Roof rack/ski rack
Remove the roof rack or the ski rack from the roof when they are not used. These accessories lower aerodynamic penetration and adversely affect electrical energy or fuel consumption levels.
Limit the loads carried in the vehicle and minimise wind resistance (e.g. roof bars, roof rack, bicycle carrier, trailer). Preferably, use a roof box.
## Electric devices
Use electrical devices only for the amount of time needed. The heated rear window, windscreen wipers and heater fan require a considerable amount of energy or fuel; increasing the current uptake increases electrical energy or fuel consumption.
## Climate control system
Using the climate control system will increase electrical energy or fuel consumption: use standard ventilation when the temperature outside permits. For electric versions: with the vehicle connected, carry out temperature preconditioning before setting off.
## Devices for aerodynamic control
The use of non-certified devices for aerodynamic control may adversely affect air drag and electrical energy or fuel consumption levels.
183
STARTING AND DRIVING
184
## DRIVING STYLE
## Top speed
Energy or fuel consumption considerably increases as speed increases. Maintain a constant speed, avoiding unnecessary braking and acceleration, which cost in terms of electrical energy or fuel consumption and emissions.
## Drive smoothly
Accelerating violently will greatly affect electrical energy or fuel consumption and emissions. Acceleration should be gradual.
Maintain a safe distance between vehicles, use engine braking rather than the brake pedal and press the accelerator gradually. These practices help to save on energy consumption, reduce CO2 emissions and decrease general traffic noise.
When the traffic is flowing smoothly, use the Cruise Control/Adaptive Cruise Control.
## Optimise your use of the gearbox
With a manual gearbox, move off gently and change up promptly. While accelerating, change up early. Do not depress the accelerator pedal heavily or suddenly.
## For electric versions
Favour the ECO zone of the operating mode indicator in the instrument panel display by driving smoothly and at a steady speed.
Anticipate slowing down as much as possible and, if possible, favour decelerations with regenerative braking mode activated (operating mode indicator in the CHARGE zone).
## CONDITIONS OF USE
## Traffic and road conditions
Heavy traffic with fast acceleration causes high electrical energy or fuel consumption. Winding mountain roads and rough road surfaces also adversely affect consumption.
## Control the use of electrical equipment
Before moving off, if the passenger compartment is too warm, ventilate it by opening the windows and air vents before using the air conditioning.
At speeds above 50 km/h (31 mph), close the windows and leave the air vents open.
Unless automatically regulated, switch off the air conditioning as soon as the desired temperature has been reached. Switch off the demisting and defrosting functions, if they are not managed automatically.
Switch off the heated seat as soon as possible.
Adapt your use of the headlamps and/or foglamps to the level of visibility, in accordance with current legislation in the country in which you are driving. Avoid running the engine before moving off, particularly in winter (other than in
severe wintry conditions: temperature below -23 ° C). The vehicle will warm up much faster while driving. As a passenger, avoid connecting your multimedia devices (e.g. film, music, video game) to help reduce the consumption of energy. Disconnect all portable devices before leaving the vehicle.
## ENERGY ECONOMY MODE
This system manages the duration of use of certain functions, in order to conserve a sufficient level of charge in the conventional battery with the ignition off. After switching off the engine, you can still use functions such as the audio and telematic system, the wipers and the dipped beam headlamps or courtesy lamps, for a combined duration of approximately 40 minutes.
## Selecting the mode
A confirmation message is displayed when energy economy mode is entered, and the active functions are placed on standby.
WARNING If a telephone call is in progress at the time, it will be maintained for around 10 minutes via the audio system's hands-free system.
## Exiting the mode
These functions are automatically reactivated the next time the vehicle is used.
To restore the use of these functions immediately, start the engine and let it run:
For less than 10 minutes, to use the equipment for approximately 5 minutes.
- For more than 10 minutes, to use the equipment for approximately 30 minutes.
Let the engine run for the specified duration to ensure that the conventional battery charge is sufficient.
To recharge the conventional battery, avoid repeatedly or continuously restarting the engine.
WARNING A flat conventional battery prevents the engine from starting. For more information on the conventional battery, refer to the "Jump starting" chapter in "In case of emergency" section.
## LOAD REDUCTION MODE
This system manages the use of certain functions according to the level of charge remaining in the conventional battery. When the vehicle is being driven, the load reduction function temporarily deactivates certain functions, such as the air conditioning and the heated rear screen.
The deactivated functions are reactivated automatically as soon as conditions permit.
## WARNINGS
- Never leave the engine running in a closed space without sufficient ventilation. Internal combustion engines emit toxic exhaust gases such as carbon monoxide. Danger of poisoning and death!
- In very severe wintry conditions (temperature below -23 ° C), let the engine run for 4 minutes before moving off, to ensure the correct operation and durability of the mechanical components of your vehicle (engine and gearbox).
- Never drive with the parking brake applied. Risk of overheating and damaging the braking system!
- Never park the vehicle and never leave the engine running on a flammable surface (e.g. dry grass, dead leaves). The vehicle exhaust system is very hot, even several minutes after the engine stops. Risk of fire!
- Never drive on surfaces covered with vegetation (e.g. tall grass, accumulated dead leaves, crops, debris) such as a field, a country lane overgrown with bushes or a grassy verge. This vegetation could come into contact with the vehicle's exhaust system or other systems which are very hot. Risk of fire!
- Make sure you do not leave any item in the passenger compartment which could act like a magnifying glass under the effect of the sun's rays and cause a fire. Risk of fire or damage to interior surfaces!
- Never leave the vehicle unattended, with the engine running. If you have to leave your vehicle with the engine running, apply the parking brake and put the gearbox into neutral or position or (depending on the type of gearbox).
- Never leave children inside the vehicle unsupervised.
## WARNING
252) Damage to the high-voltage battery or high voltage system can create a risk of electric shock, overheating, or fire. If the vehicle has been damaged or affected by a moderate to severe crash, it must be inspected as soon as possible by qualified personnel. Until the technical inspection has been carried out, the vehicle must be stored outside at a minimum distance of 5 metres from any structure or other flammable objects. If the vehicle has been damaged or affected by flood or fire, it must not be moved at all and has to be inspected by qualified personnel as soon as possible.

## TRAILER HITCH
(where admitted)
## GENERAL INFORMATION
Only use towing equipment that has been approved for your vehicle.
Entrust retrofitting of towing equipment to a Jeep Dealership. It may be necessary to make changes that affect the cooling system, heat shields or other equipment.
Trailers equipped with LED lights are not suitable for the wiring harness of this trailer hitch.
Fitting of towing equipment could cover the opening of the towing eye. If this is the case, use the coupling ball bar for towing. Always keep the coupling ball bar in the vehicle to have it on hand if needed.
## DRIVING CHARACTERISTICS AND TOWING TIPS
Before attaching a trailer, lubricate the coupling ball. However, do not do so if a stabiliser, which acts on the coupling ball, is being used to reduce snaking movements.
During trailer towing do not exceed a speed of 80 km/h. A maximum speed of 100 km/h is only appropriate if an oscillation damper is used and the permissible gross trailer weight does not exceed the vehicle's curb weight.
For trailers with low driving stability and caravan trailers, the use of an oscillation damper is strongly recommended.
If the trailer starts snaking, drive more slowly, do not attempt to correct the steering and brake sharply if necessary.
When driving downhill, drive in the same gear as if driving uphill and drive at a similar speed.
Adjust tyre pressure to the value specified for full load
## TRAILER TOWING
## Trailer loads
The permissible trailer loads are vehicle and engine-dependent maximum values which must not be exceeded. The actual trailer load is the difference between the actual gross weight of the trailer and the actual coupling socket load with the trailer coupled.
The permissible trailer loads are specified in the vehicle documents. In general, they are valid for gradients up to 12%.
The permissible trailer load applies up to the specified incline and at sea level. Since engine power decreases as altitude increases due to the air becoming thinner, therefore reducing climbing ability, the permissible gross train weight also decreases by 10% for every 1000 m of altitude. The gross train weight does not have to be reduced when driving on roads with slight inclines (less than 8%, e.g. motorways)
The permissible gross train weight must not be exceeded. This weight is specified on the identification plate.
## Vertical coupling load
The vertical coupling load is the load exerted by the trailer on the coupling ball. It can be varied by changing the weight distribution when loading the trailer.
The maximum permissible vertical coupling load (48 kg) is specified on the towing equipment identification plate and in the vehicle documents.
Always aim for the maximum vertical coupling load, especially in the case of heavy trailers. The vertical coupling load should never fall below 25 kg.
## Rear axle load
When the trailer is coupled and the towing vehicle fully loaded, the permissible rear axle load (see identification plate or vehicle documents) may be exceeded by 60 kg, the gross vehicle weight rating must not be exceeded. If the permissible rear axle load is exceeded, a maximum speed of 100 km/h applies.
## TOW HOOK SETUP
253) 254)
Instructions for using the removable ball head tow bar
WARNING Before setting off, check the correct locking of the removable ball head tow bar, as follows:
the green mark of the knob must coincide with the green mark on the tow bar
the knob is in the stop position on the tow bar (without slot)
- locked lock and key removed. The knob cannot be extracted.
- ball head bar firmly secured to the housing pipe. Check by shaking it with hands
The fitting procedure must be repeated if any of the requirements are not met.
If even only one of the requirements is not met the tow hook must not be used, since there is risk of causing accidents. Contact a Jeep Dealership.
The ball head tow bar can be fitted/removed manually, without requiring specific equipment.
WARNING Never use cars or work tools: the mechanism may be damaged.
WARNING Never unlock in the case of trailer attached to the car or with rack fitted.
WARNING When driving without trailer (or without rack), the ball head tow bar must be removed and the closing cap must always be inserted in the housing pipe. This applies particularly if, due to the bar, the visibility of the number plate or of the lighting system is reduced.
For the electrical connection, a 13 pin 12V DC connection has to be used (CUNA/UNI and ISO/DIN Standards). Follow the instructions provided by the car Manufacturer and/or the tow hook Manufacturer.
## WARNING
253) The ABS with which the car is equipped will not control the braking system of the trailer. Particular caution is therefore required on slippery roads.
- 254) Never modify the braking system of the vehicle to control the trailer brake. The trailer braking system must be fully independent of the vehicle's hydraulic system.
## IMPORTANT
115) For new vehicles, only tow a trailer after having driven at least 1000 km.

116)
## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
Observe the following precautions:
before replacing a bulb check the contacts for oxidation
replace blown bulbs with others of the same type and power
after replacing a headlight bulb, always check its alignment
if a bulb is not working, before replacing it, check that the respective fuse is intact. For the location of the fuse, refer to the "Fuse Replacement" chapter in this section.
WARNING When the weather is cold or damp or after heavy rain or washing, the surface of headlights or rear lights may steam up and/or form drops of condensation on the inside. This is a natural phenomenon due to the difference in temperature and humidity between the inside and the outside of the glass which does not indicate an anomaly fault and does not compromise the normal operation of lighting devices.
193
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
194
The mist disappears quickly when the lights are turned on, starting from the centre of the diffuser, extending progressively towards the edges.
## WARNING
264) Before replacing the bulb, wait for the exhaust ducts to cool down: DANGER OF SCALDING!
265) Modifications or repairs to the electric system that are not carried out properly or do not take the system technical specifications into account can cause malfunctions leading to the risk of fire.
266) Halogen bulbs contain pressurised gas, in the case of breakage they may burst causing glass fragments to be projected outwards.
267) Only replace the light bulbs when the engine is off and in a position that does not interfere with traffic and lets you safely replace them (see the description in the "Replacement" chapter). Also make sure that the engine is cold, to avoid burns.
268) In case of regulation of headlamps beam height or bulb replacement, never look directly to the lamps if they are switched on. Risk of eye injuries!
## IMPORTANT
116) Halogen bulbs must be handled holding the metallic part only. Touching the transparent part of the bulb with your fingers may reduce the intensity
of the emitted light and even reduce the lifespan of the bulb. In the event of accidental contact, wipe the bulb with a cloth moistened with alcohol and let the bulb dry.

## WHEEL CHANGING
Make the following preparations and observe the following information:
stop the vehicle in a position that is not dangerous for oncoming traffic where you can replace the tyre safely, as far as possible from the side of the road. The ground must be as level and compact as possible. The front wheels must be in the straight ahead position
switch on the hazard warning lights, apply the parking brake and engage the first gear if the vehicle is facing uphill or reverse if it is facing downhill (for manual gearbox) or put the PRND command on P (for Electric Drive Unit), and leave the wheels steered
switch off the engine
before getting out of the vehicle, put on the reflective safety jacket (if required by the regulations in force). In any case, follow the road safety laws in force in the country where you are travelling place the chock provided under the wheel diagonally opposite the wheel to be changed
- if the ground on which the vehicle is standing is soft, a solid board (approx. 1 cm thick) should be placed under the jack
- take heavy objects out of the vehicle before jacking up
- alert any bystander that the vehicle is about to be raised: all persons should be kept away from the car and nobody must touch it until it has been lowered. Nor should any occupant remain in the vehicle
never crawl under a jacked-up vehicle do not start the vehicle when it is raised on the jack
- before screwing in the wheel bolts, clean them
279) 280)
Depending on the wheel rim material (steel or alloy), two different bolts are available (fig. 272, fig. 273).
273
Use the correct wheel bolts for the respective wheels.

## Fitting the spare wheel
274
JJ000275
WARNING The spare wheel is secured by the conical contact of each bolt if the wheel bolts for the alloy wheels are used (fig. 274). In this case, the washers do not come into contact with the spare wheel.
Disengage wheel bolt caps (where present) with the wheel bolt cover remover. Steel wheels with cover: Pull off the wheel cover
## 275
JJ000633
remove the antitheft bolt (where provided) with the dedicated tool attach the wheel wrench and loosen each wheel bolt by half a turn fig. 275. The wheels might be protected by locking wheel nuts (optional). To loosen these specific nuts first attach the adapter onto the head of the nut before installing the wheel wrench. The adapter is located in the tool bag
before positioning the jack, take care to remove the cover in the lifting point fig. 276 by acting on the fastening buttons using a special tool (screwdriver) contained in the equipment of the car. After removing the jack, be sure to reapply the cover
277
JJ000640
ensure the jack is correctly positioned under the relevant vehicle jacking point
turn the lever (1) clockwise until the jack bracket is firmly inserted in the lifting area (2) fig. 277 of the underdoor side member
- position the jack directly below the jacking point in a manner that prevents it from slipping fig. 278
WARNING Ensure that the jack is stable. If the ground is slippery or loose, the jack may slip or collapse - risk of injury! Take care to position the jack strictly at one of the jacking points under the vehicle, ensuring that the head of the jack is centred under the contact area on the vehicle. Otherwise, there is a risk of damage to the vehicle and/or of the jack collapsing - risk of injury!
278
JJ000641
- ensure that the edge of the body fits into the notch of the jack (2) fig. 277
- with the jack correctly aligned rotate wheel wrench until wheel is clear of the ground
- unscrew the wheel nuts and store them in a clean place
- remove the wheel and replace it with the spare one
- screw on the wheel nuts by hand as far as possible
- if present, pre-tighten the security bolt using the wheel wrench equipped with the adapter for the locking wheel nut lower the vehicle and remove the jack
install the wheel wrench ensuring that it is located securely and tighten each bolt in a crosswise sequence. If the vehicle is equipped with alloy wheels, note that the wheel bolts can also be used for the steel spare wheel. In this case, the spare wheel is secured by the conical contact of each bolt
stow the replaced wheel, the vehicle tools and the adapter for the locking wheel nuts. The punctured wheel cannot be stored in place of the spare wheel. Place it in the boot
check the tyre pressure of the installed tyre and the wheel nut torque as soon as possible
## WARNINGS
- Never change more than one wheel at once.
- Use the jack only to change wheels in case of puncture, not for seasonal winter or summer tyre change.
- The jack is maintenance-free.
- If it should it be absolutely necessary to operate on the road surface or near
- it, pay the utmost attention to cars in transit
Pay particular attention when using the wrench to remove the wheel fastening bolts: it may have sharp edges Raising the car more than necessary may lower its stability. The jack may slip and injure those nearby. Do not raise the car more than required for the removal of the wheel
- Tyres with unidirectional tread can be recognised by arrows on the side of the tyre which indicate the direction of rotation. It is mandatory to comply with this direction. Only in this way, tyres maintain their characteristics in terms of grip, noise, resistance to wear and drainage on wet surfaces
If, after a puncture, it is necessary to fit such a tyre the wrong way round, it will be necessary to continue driving with great care, since the tyre's performance is limited in these conditions. This precaution must be borne in mind above all when the road surface is wet In order to benefit completely from the unidirectional tread, it is advisable to restore all wheels to the correct direction of rotation as soon as possible
- Make sure that the spare wheel is fitted with the valve facing outwards. The wheel may be damaged if fitted incorrectly
- If the car has a hub cap or wheel cover, do not attempt to fit it on the spare wheel
201
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
202
- To prevent injury to persons, the complete tightening of the bolts must only be carried out when all of the car's wheels are on the ground, to prevent the car falling from the jack
After having travelled for about 40 km, stop and check that the fastening bolts are tightened correctly
Have the tightening of the spare wheel's bolts and its tyre pressure checked by a Jeep Dealership. Have the punctured tyre examined. After inspection, the technician will advise you on whether the tyre can be repaired or if it must be replaced.
## After refitting the repaired standard wheel Proceed as follows:
stow the space-saver spare wheel in the dedicated housing of the boot place the jack and the other tools in the dedicated area of the boot correctly reposition the boot floor
## Stowing a damaged full size wheel in the load compartment
The spare wheel well is not designed for other tyre sizes than the spare wheel. A damaged full size wheel must be stowed in the load compartment and secured properly.
## WARNING
271) A punctured tire or jack thrown forward in a collision or hard stop, could endanger the occupants of the vehicle. For this reason, both the jack and the punctured tire should always be safety placed in the appropriate compartment in the trunk.
- 272) It is extremely dangerous to attempt to change a wheel on the side of the car next to the driving lane: make sure that the car is at a sufficient distance from the road, to avoid being run over.
273) Indicate the presence of the stationary car in accordance with current regulations: hazard warning lights, warning triangle, etc. Those on board should get out of the car, especially if it is heavily laden, and wait for the wheel to be replaced away from the threat posed by the traffic. On gradients or on unsurfaced roads, chock the wheels with the wedge provided (where provided).
274) The vehicle's driving characteristics will be modified with the spare tire fitted. Avoid sudden starting or stopping, sharp or fast turns. The total life of a spacesaver spare wheel is approximately 3,000 km, after which it must be replaced by another wheel of the same type. Never install a standard tire on a rim that is designed for use with a space-saver spare wheel. Have the tire repaired and refitted as soon as possible. Using two or more space-saver wheels at the same time is forbidden. Do not grease the threads of the fastening bolts before fitting them: they might slip out when driving!
- 275) The space-saver wheel is specific to your car: do not use it on other models, or use the space-saver wheel of other models on your car. The space-saver wheel must only be used in the event of an emergency. Never use it for more than strictly necessary and never exceed 80 km/h (50 mph). "Warning! For temporary use only! 80 km/h (50 mph) max!" Replace with standard wheel as soon as possible. Never remove or cover the sticker on the space-saver wheel. Never apply a wheel cap on a space-saver wheel. The vehicle's driving characteristics will be modified with the space-saver wheel fitted. Avoid violent acceleration and braking, abrupt steering and fast cornering.
276) The jack is a tool developed and designed only for changing a wheel, if a tire gets punctured or damaged, on the car with which it is supplied or on other cars of the same model. Any other use, e.g. to jack up other vehicle models or different things, is strictly prohibited. Never use it to carry out maintenance or repairs under the vehicle or to change summer/winter wheels and vice versa; we advise you to contact a Jeep Dealership. Never go under the raised vehicle: use it only in the positions indicated. Do not use the jack to lift loads heavier than that indicated on the label affixed to the jack. Never start the engine with vehicle raised. If the vehicle is raised more than necessary, everything can become more unstable, with the risk of the vehicle dropping violently. Therefore, only lift the car just enough to access the space-saver spare wheel (where provided).
277) When turning the jack handle make sure that it can turn freely without scraping your hand against the ground. The moving components of the jack ("worm screw" and joints) can also cause injuries: do not touch them. If you come into contact with lubricating grease, clean yourself thoroughly.
278) The space-saver wheel cannot be fitted with snow chains. If a front (drive) tyre is punctured and chains are needed, use a standard wheel from the rear axle and install the space-saver wheel on the rear axle. In this way, with two normal drive wheels at the front axle, it is possible to use snow chains.
279) Do not grease wheel bolts.
280) Ensure to use always the correct wheel bolts if changing the wheels. When installing the spare wheel for temporary usage, the bolts for alloy wheels can also be used.
## IMPORTANT
118) The use of a spare wheel that is smaller than the other wheels or in combination with winter tyres could affect driveability. Have the defective tyre replaced as soon as possible.
## TYRE REPAIR KIT
(where provided)
Made up of a compressor and a sealant cartridge, it allows you to carry out a temporary repair of the tyre so that you can drive to the nearest garage.
Minor damage to the tyre tread can be repaired with the tyre repair kit. It is designed to repair most punctures located on the tyre tread.

- 4. Connect the other end of the black cable from the backup battery to a fastening bracket on the 12V battery's negative ( -) (4) or to the vehicle grounding point (5) near the 12V battery in the engine compartment.
## Starting using a booster (case B)
Cable connection order:
- 1. Connect the red cable of the booster (1) to the positive terminal (+) of the discharged battery (at the metal elbow) (2) fig. 287.
- 2. Connect the black cable from the booster (3) to a fastening bracket on the 12V battery's negative ( -) (4) or to the vehicle grounding point (5) near the 12V battery in the engine compartment.
Route the leads so that they cannot catch on rotating parts in the engine compartment.
To start the engine:
- 1. Start the engine of the vehicle providing the jump.
- 2. After 5 minutes, start the other engine. Start attempts should be made for no longer than 15 seconds at an interval of 1 minute.
- 3. Allow both engines to idle for approx. 3 minutes with the leads connected.
- 4. Switch on electrical consumers e.g. headlights, heated rear window.
- 5. Reverse above sequence exactly when removing leads.
## WARNING
- 283) Be extremely careful when starting with jump leads. Any deviation from the following instructions can lead to injuries or damage caused by battery explosion or damage to the electrical systems of both vehicles.
- 284) Avoid contact of the battery fluid with eyes, skin, fabrics and painted surfaces. The fluid contains sulphuric acid which can cause injuries and damage in the event of direct contact. 285) Do not get too close to the radiator cooling fan: the electric fan may start; danger of injury. Scarves, ties and other loose clothing might be pulled by moving parts.
- 286) Remove any metal objects (e.g. rings, watches, bracelets), that might cause an accidental electrical contact and cause serious injury.
- 287) Protect your eyes and face before handling the battery. All operations on the battery must be carried out in a well ventilated area and away from naked flames and sources of sparks, to avoid any risk of explosion or fire. Wash your hands afterwards.
- 288) Never try to charge a frozen battery risk of explosion! If the battery has frozen, have it checked by a Jeep Dealership, who will verify that the internal components have not been damaged and
that the case has not cracked, which could lead to a risk of leakage of toxic and corrosive acid.
## IMPORTANT
- 120) Never jump start another vehicle with an electric vehicle.
- 121) Never connect the negative jump lead to the metal part of the electronic control units or at the back of the headlamps. Risk of destroying the electronic control units and/or headlamps! Connect to the remote earth point provided for this purpose.
- 122) With Electric Drive Unit, never try to start the engine by pushing the vehicle.
- 123) Never start the engine by connecting a battery charger. Never use a 24 V or higher battery booster. Check beforehand that the backup battery has a nominal voltage of 12 V and a capacity at least equal to that of the discharged battery. The two vehicles must not be in contact with each other. Switch off all electricityconsuming equipment on both vehicles (audio system, wipers, lighting, etc.). Make sure that the jump leads are well away from the engine's moving parts (fan, belt, etc.). Do not disconnect the (+) terminal while the engine is running.
- 124) Driving immediately without having reached a sufficient level of charge may affect some of the vehicle's functions (e.g. Stop-Start).
207
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
208
## IMPORTANT
- 6) These batteries contain harmful substances (sulphuric acid and lead). They must be disposed of in accordance with regulations and must never under any circumstances be discarded with household waste. Dispose of used batteries at a designated collection point.
## TOWING
## TOWING THE VEHICLE
289) 290) 291) 292) 293) 294)
A professional towing service must be called if:
broken down on a motorway or main road
not possible to put the gearbox into neutral, unlock the steering, or release the parking brake
towing with only two wheels on the ground
no approved towbar available
WARNING For electric versions: before any intervention, with the ignition on, depress the brake pedal and select mode N, then switch off the electric transmission system (READY indicator lamp off). Always call on professionals for recovery of the vehicle on a flatbed lorry or trailer. Use the towing eye only to free the vehicle if it is stuck, or to secure it for recovery on a flatbed lorry or trailer.
## TOWING CONSTRAINTS
1.2 100 hp gasoline FWD with manual transmission, fig. 288
- Rear wheels on the ground: YES
Flatbed: YES
4 wheels on the ground with towbar: YES
Front wheels on the ground: YES
e Full Electric 50 kWh battery capacity with Electric Drive Unit, fig. 289
Rear wheels on the ground: NO Flatbed: YES
- Rear wheels on the flatbed, front wheels on the trailer: NO
- Front wheels on the ground: NO
## TOWING PROCEDURE
290
JJ000389
Remove the cap fig. 290 using the screwdriver.
The towing eye is located in a box below the floor cover in the load compartment fig. 291 or directly in the toolbag.
292 JJ000524 Screw in the towing eye as far as it will go until it stops in a horizontal position fig. 292.
Attach the tow rod to the towing eye. The towing eye must only be used for towing and not for recovering the vehicle. Switch on ignition to release steering wheel lock and to permit operation of brake lights, horn and windscreen wiper.
Switch the selector lever to neutral (versions with manual transmission) or
the PRND command to N (versions with Electric Drive Unit).
Release the parking brake.
## 126)
When the engine is not running, considerably more force is needed to brake and steer.
To prevent the entry of exhaust gases from the towing vehicle, switch on the air recirculation and close the windows. After towing, unscrew the towing eye. Insert cap with the flange into the recess and fix cap by pushing.
## WARNING
289) Observe the legislation in force in the country where you are driving. Ensure that the weight of the towing vehicle is higher than that of the towed vehicle. The driver must remain at the wheel of the towed vehicle and must have a valid driving licence. When towing a vehicle with all four wheels on the ground, always use an approved towing arm; rope and straps are prohibited. The towing vehicle must move off gently.
290) For versions with radio remote control, turn the ignition key to the ENGINE position and then to STOP without removing it before towing. The steering column will automatically lock when the key is removed and the wheels cannot be steered. Also check that the manual transmission is in neutral (on versions with Electric Drive Unit check that the PRND command is in N
position). For versions with electronic key system, set the ignition device to the ENGINE position and then to STOP, without opening the door.
291) The brake servo and the electromechanical power steering will not work while the vehicle is being towed. You will therefore need to apply more force on the brake pedal and steering wheel. Do not use flexible ropes when towing, and avoid jerky movements. While towing, make sure that the trailer hitch does not damage any components it is touching. When towing the car, you must comply with all specific traffic regulations and adopt an appropriate driving behaviour. Do not start the engine while towing the vehicle. Before tightening the ring, clean the threaded housing thoroughly. Make sure that the ring is fully screwed into the housing before towing the car.
292) The front and rear tow hooks should be used only for emergencies on the road. You are allowed to tow the vehicle for short distances using an appropriate device in accordance with the highway code (a rigid bar), to move the vehicle on the road in readiness for towing or transport via a breakdown vehicle. Tow hooks MUST NOT be used to tow vehicles off the road or where there are obstacles and/or for towing operations using cables or other non-rigid devices. In compliance with the above conditions, towing must take place with the two vehicles (one towing, the other towed) aligned as much as possible along the same centre line. 293) In case of rescue: park the vehicle at a safe distance from the other vehicles.
209
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
210
294) In case of rescue, for Electric vehicles: high-voltage battery, re-ignition is possible!
## IMPORTANT
125) Deactivate the driver assistance systems like active emergency braking, otherwise the vehicle may automatically brake during towing.
126) Drive slowly. Do not drive jerkily. Excessive tractive force can damage the vehicle.
## FREE-WHEELING
In certain situations, it is necessary to put the vehicle into free-wheeling mode (e.g. on a rolling road, automatic car wash (Wash mode), rail or sea transport).
## WITH A MANUAL GEARBOX AND ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE
## To release them
With the engine running and while depressing the brake pedal, move the gear selector to the neutral position
while depressing the brake pedal, switch off the ignition
release the brake pedal, then switch on the ignition again
- while depressing the brake pedal, press the control lever to release the parking brake
release the brake pedal, then switch off the ignition
## Reverting to normal operation
While depressing the brake pedal, restart the engine

Pull out the dipstick, wipe it clean, reinsert it fully, pull out and read the engine oil level fig. 304.
Check that the oil level is between the MIN and MAX references on the dipstick. When the engine oil level has dropped to the MIN mark, top up the engine oil through the oil filler (1) fig. 304.
We recommend the use of the same grade of engine oil that was used at last change.
The engine oil level must not exceed the MAX mark on the dipstick.
Fit the cap on straight and tighten it.
## Engine coolant (Petrol engines)
It is normal to top up this fluid between two services.
The check and top-up must only be done with the engine cold.
A level of coolant that is too low risks causing major damage to the engine. Open the cap (2) fig. 305. The coolant
227
SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE
228
level must be close to the "MAX" mark without ever going above it.
If the level is close to or below the "MIN" mark, it is essential to top it up. When the engine is hot, the temperature of the coolant is regulated by the fan. As the cooling system is pressurised, wait at least one hour after switching off the engine before carrying out any work. In order to avoid the risk of scalding if you need to top up in an emergency, wrap a cloth around the cap and unscrew the cap by two turns to allow the pressure to drop.
Once the pressure has dropped, remove the cap and top up to the required level.

which is appropriate for the temperature conditions must be used in order to protect the system's components (pump, tank, ducts, jets).
136)
## Brakes
Depending on the driving style, the brake wear may vary significantly.The brake wear may increase when the vehicle is driven over short distances, e.g. in the city.
It may be necessary to have the condition of the brakes checked, even between vehicle services.
Unless there is a leak in the circuit, a drop in the brake fluid level indicates that the brake pads are worn.
Once new brake linings are installed, do not brake unnecessarily hard for the first few journeys.
WARNING After washing the vehicle, moisture, or in wintry conditions, ice can form on the brake discs and pads: braking efficiency may be reduced. Gently dab the brakes to dry and defrost them.
For information on checking brake disc wear, contact a Jeep Dealership.
## Brake fluid (4) fig. 308
308 JJ000532 The brake fluid level must be between the MIN and MAX marks. If fluid level is below MIN seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership.
## Conventional battery
The conventional battery is maintenancefree provided that the driving profile allows sufficient charging of the battery. Short-distance-driving and frequent engine starts can discharge the battery. Avoid the use of unnecessary electrical consumers.
Check regularly that the terminals are correctly tightened (versions without quick-release terminals) and that the connections are clean.
WARNING Versions equipped with StopStart are fitted with a conventional leadacid battery of specific technology and specification. Its replacement should be carried out only by a Jeep Dealership.
309 JJ000005\_2 Batteries do not belong in household waste. They must be disposed of at an appropriate recycling collection point. Laying up the vehicle for more than four weeks can lead to battery discharge. Disconnect the clamp from the negative terminal of the conventional battery. Ensure the ignition is switched off before connecting or disconnecting the conventional battery.
## Useful advice for extending the life of your conventional battery
To avoid draining your conventional battery and make it last longer, observe the following instructions:
when you park the car, ensure that the doors, tailgate and bonnet are closed properly, to prevent any ceiling lights from remaining on inside the passenger compartment
switch off all ceiling lights inside the car: the car is however equipped with a system which switches all internal lights off automatically
do not keep accessories (e.g. radio, hazard warning lights, etc.) switched on for a long time when the engine is not running
before performing any operation on the electrical system disconnect the cable from the negative conventional battery terminal. If, after purchasing the car, you wish to install electrical accessories which require permanent electrical supply (e.g. alarm, etc.) or accessories which influence the electrical supply requirements, contact a Jeep Dealership, whose qualified staff will evaluate the overall electrical consumption
WARNING After the battery is disconnected, the steering could be initialised. If so, the warning light on the instrument panel switches on to indicate this. To carry out this procedure turn the steering wheel all the way from one end to the other or drive in a straight line for about a hundred metres.
WARNING If the charge level remains under 50% for a long time, the conventional battery is damaged by sulphation, reducing its capacity and efficiency at start-up. The battery is also more prone to the risk of freezing (at temperatures of - 10 ° C/14 ° F). Refer to the "Car inactivity" chapter this section if the car is left parked for a long time.
## Replacing the conventional battery
WARNING Any deviation from the instructions given in this section may
229
SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE
230
lead to temporary deactivation or disturbance of the Stop-Start system.
When the conventional battery is being replaced, please ensure that there are no open ventilation holes in the vicinity of the positive terminal. If a ventilation hole is open in this area, it must be closed off with a dummy cap, and the ventilation in the vicinity of the negative terminal must be opened.
Ensure that the battery is always replaced by the same type of battery. The conventional battery has to be replaced by a Jeep Dealership.
## Charging the conventional battery
WARNING After setting the ignition device to STOP and closing the driver's door, wait at least one minute before disconnecting the electrical supply from the conventional battery. When reconnecting the electrical supply to the conventional battery, make sure that the ignition device is in the STOP position and the driver's door is closed.
WARNING Charging should be slow at a low ampere rating for approximately 24 hours. Charging for a longer time may damage the conventional battery.
WARNING The cables of the electrical system must be correctly reconnected to the conventional battery, i.e. the positive cable (+) to the positive terminal and
the negative cable ( -) to the negative terminal.
The conventional battery terminals are marked with the positive (+) and negative (-) terminal symbols, and are shown on the cover of the battery itself.
The battery terminals must also be corrosion-free and firmly secured to the terminals. If a "quick-type" conventional battery charger is used with the battery fitted on the car, before connecting it disconnect both cables of the conventional battery itself. Do not use a "quick-type" battery charger to provide the starting voltage.
## Discharge protection Battery voltage
When the conventional battery voltage is running low, a warning message will appear in the instrument panel display. When the vehicle is being driven, the load reduction function temporarily deactivates certain functions, such as the air conditioning, the heated rear window, heated steering wheel, etc.
The deactivated functions are reactivated automatically as soon as conditions permit.
## Idle boost
If charging of the conventional battery is required due to battery condition, the power output of the generator must be increased. This will be achieved by an idle boost which may be audible.
A message appears in the instrument panel display.
## Power outlet
The power outlets are deactivated in the event of low conventional battery voltage.
## Power saving mode
This mode deactivates electrical consumers to avoid excessive discharging of the conventional battery. These consumers, such as the Infotainment system, windscreen wipers, low beam headlights, courtesy light, etc. can be used for a total maximum time of about 40 minutes after ignition is switched off.
## Changing into power saving mode
When power saving mode is activated, a message appears in the instrument panel display.
An active telephone call using the handsfree option will be maintained for around 10 minutes longer.
## Deactivating power saving mode
Power saving mode is deactivated automatically when the engine is restarted. Run the engine for a sufficient charge:
for less than 10 minutes to use the consumers for approx. 5 minutes for more than 10 minutes to use the consumers for up to approx. 30 minutes
## Heating functionalities
NOTE Individual heating functionalities, such as heated seats or heated steering
wheel, may be temporarily unavailable in the event of electrical loading constraints. Functions will be resumed after some minutes.
## ELECTRIC PARKING BRAKE
This system does not require any routine servicing. However, in the event of a problem, do not hesitate to have the system checked by a Jeep Dealership. For more information on the Electric parking brake, refer to the "Parking brake" chapter in "Starting and driving" section.
## SHOCK ABSORBERS
It is not easy for drivers to detect when shock absorbers are worn. Nevertheless, the shock absorbers have a major impact on road holding and braking performance. For your safety and driving comfort, it is important to have them regularly checked by a Jeep Dealership.
## TIMING AND ACCESSORY KITS
The timing and accessory kits are used from the time the engine is started until it is switched off. It is normal for them to wear over time.
A faulty timing or accessory kit can damage the engine, rendering it unusable. Observe the recommended replacement frequency, stated in distance travelled or time elapsed, whichever is reached first.

## AIR CONDITIONING REGULAR OPERATION
139) 140)
In order to ensure continuously efficient performance, cooling must be operated for a few minutes once a month, irrespective of the weather and time of year. Operation with cooling is not possible when the outside temperature is too low.
Depending on the environment and the use of the vehicle (e.g. dusty atmosphere, city driving), change it twice as often, if necessary.
NOTE A clogged passenger compartment filter can adversely affect air conditioning system performance and generate undesirable odours.
## EXHAUST SYSTEM
313) 314)
141)
Adequate maintenance of the engine exhaust system represents the best protection against leaks of carbon monoxide into the passenger compartment.
## WARNING
295) The air intake system (air cleaner, rubber hoses, etc.) can be a protection in the case of blowbacks from the engine. DO NOT REMOVE this system unless you need to carry out repair or maintenance. Before starting the engine, ensure that the system has not been removed: failure to observe this precaution may result in serious injury.
296) Only perform engine compartment checks when the ignition is off. The cooling fan may start operating even if the ignition is off.
- 297) The ignition system uses extremely high voltage. Do not touch.
- 298) Take care with objects or clothing that could be caught in the blades of the cooling fan or in certain moving components - risk of strangulation and serious injury! Before carrying out any work under the bonnet, you must switch off the ignition, check that the READY
indicator lamp is off on the instrument panel and disconnect the charging nozzle if it is plugged in.
- 299) Electric versions: Never try to perform maintenance work on high voltage components yourself. You may be injured and the vehicle may be damaged. Service and repair of these high voltage components should only be performed by a trained service technician with proper knowledge and tools. Exposure to high voltage may cause shock, burns, and even death. The high voltage components in the vehicle can only be serviced by technicians with special training. High voltage components are identified by labels. Do not remove, open, take apart, or modify these components. High voltage cable or wiring has orange covering. Do not probe, tamper with, cut, or modify high voltage cable or wiring.
- 300) The electric powertrain uses a voltage of 350 V. This system may be hot both when the ignition is on and after switching it off. Comply with the warning messages shown on the labels, particularly inside the charging flap.
- 301) High voltage system voltage is dangerous and can cause burns or other injuries or even fatal electric shock. Since damage to high voltage components is not visible, Jeep recommends that you: never touch the components, damaged or not, and never let your jewelry or other metallic objects come into contact with these components; never work on the orange high voltage cables or on any other high voltage component marked with the label .
- 302) Any intervention on the high voltage system must be carried out by qualified persons in workshops qualified and approved to carry out this type of work; never damage, modify or remove the orange high voltage cables or disconnect them from the high voltage network; never open, modify or remove the cover of the traction battery; never work with cutting and forming tools or heat sources near high voltage components and cables. 303) In case of low level of fluid in the cooling tank, the refilling shall only be performed in a qualified and trained workshop to verify that the leakage is not in the traction battery. Any intervention on the high voltage system must be carried out by qualified persons in workshops qualified and approved to carry out this type of work.
- 304) Take care when working under the bonnet, as certain areas of the engine may be extremely hot (risk of burns) and the cooling fan could start at any time (even with the ignition off).
- 305) Never smoke while working in the engine compartment: gas and inflammable vapours may be present, with the risk of fire.
- 306) When working in the engine compartment pay special attention to mechanical components that can move suddenly, pressurized or very hot liquids and live electrical parts.
- 307) NEVER touch the high-voltage system components (identified by the orange colour), as this could result in serious injury or death from electric shock.
- 308) Do not pour water or any other type of liquid onto the high voltage system components inside the engine compartment. Risk of death by electric shock and/or damage to the system.
- 309) For electric versions: do not operate in the engine compartment while the vehicle is charging or when the connector on the charging port is plugged in.
- 310) Avoid prolonged contact of used oil or fluids with the skin. Most of these fluids are harmful to health and very corrosive.
- 311) Brake fluid is poisonous and corrosive. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, fabrics and painted surfaces. In the event of accidental contact, immediately wash the affected parts with water and mild soap. Then rinse thoroughly. Call a doctor immediately if swallowed.
- 312) On vehicles with Stop-Start system, ensure that the charging potential does not exceed 14.6 V when using a battery charger. Otherwise the conventional battery may be damaged.
- 313) Exhaust emissions are very dangerous, and may be lethal. They contain carbon monoxide, a colourless, odourless gas which can cause fainting and poisoning if inhaled.
- 314) The exhaust system may reach high temperatures and may cause a fire if the car is parked on flammable material. Dry grass or leaves can also catch fire if they come into contact with the exhaust system. Do not park or use the car in a place in which the exhaust system might come into contact with flammable material.
IMPORTANT
- 127) When transporting the vehicle on a train or on a recovery vehicle, the mud flaps might be damaged.
- 128) Incorrect servicing of the car or failure to carry out operations or repairs (when necessary) may lead to more expensive repairs, damage to other components or have a negative impact on the car performance. Have any malfunction inspected immediately by a Jeep Dealership.
- 129) The car is filled with fluids which are optimised or protecting its performance and life and extending service intervals. Do not use chemicals for washing these components since they may damage the engine, the transmission or the climate control system. This damage is not covered by the car's warranty. If any component needs to be washed due to malfunctioning, use only the specific liquid for that procedure.
- 130) It is recommended to have the car serviced by a Jeep Dealership. When carrying out normal periodic operations and small servicing interventions personally on the vehicle, it is recommended to use suitable equipment, genuine spare parts and the necessary fluids. Do not carry out any interventions if you don't have the necessary experience.
- 131) Electric versions: Even small amounts of contamination to the liquids can cause damage to vehicle systems. Do not allow contaminants to contact the fluids or reservoir caps.

- 132) Before topping up or changing the engine oil, check that the oil is suitable for your engine and complies with the recommendations in the service schedule supplied with the vehicle (or available from your Jeep Dealership). Use of nonrecommended oil may invalidate your warranty in the event of engine failure.
- 133) Be careful not to confuse the various types of fluids while topping up: they are not compatible with one another! Topping up with an unsuitable fluid could severely damage your vehicle.
- 134) An excessive or insufficient amount of oil inside the base is extremely damaging to the engine. Make sure it is always at an adequate level.
- 135) Overfilled engine oil must be drained or suctioned out. If the oil exceeds the maximum level, do not start the vehicle and contact a Jeep Dealership.
- 136) Filling with pure water is prohibited in all circumstances (risk of freezing, limescale, etc.).. Only washer fluid with a sufficient antifreeze concentration provides protection at low temperatures or a sudden drop in temperature.
- 137) Using transmission fluid different from that approved may compromise the quality of gear changes and/or cause vibration of the transmission.
- 138) Attach the wiper blade to the inner position of the wiper arm and push until it engages.
- 139) Always require the use of only compressor coolants and lubricants approved and suitable for the specific air conditioning system fitted on the car. Some non-approved coolants are flammable and may explode, with the risk of injuries. The use of non-approved
coolants or lubricants may adversely affect system efficiency, leading to expensive repairs.
- 140) The air conditioner system contains coolant under high pressure: to avoid injuries to people or damage to the system, any coolant addition or repair that requires to disconnect the cables must be carried out by a Jeep Dealership.
- 141) Vehicles equipped with catalytic converter must be fuelled only with unleaded petrol. Leaded petrol would permanently damage the catalytic converter and eliminate its ability to reduce polluting emissions, seriously compromising the engine performance, which would be irreparably damaged. If the engine does not work correctly, especially if it starts irregularly or if there is a reduction of its performance, immediately go to a Jeep Dealership. Prolonged and faulty operation of the engine may cause overheating of the converter and, as a consequence, possible damage to the converter and the vehicle.
## IMPORTANT
7) Do not discard used oil or fluids into sewers or onto the ground. Empty used oil into the containers reserved for this purpose at a dealer or a qualified workshop.

## IMPORTANT
- 145) Abrasive products and/or polishes should not be used for cleaning the car. Bird droppings must be washed off immediately and thoroughly as the acid they contain is particularly aggressive. Avoid parking the vehicle under trees (unless it is absolutely necessary). Remove any resinous plant matter immediately because, once it has dried, it may require the use of abrasive and/or polishing products to be removed, which are strongly discouraged as they could potentially alter the characteristics of the paintwork. Do not use pure windscreen washer fluid for cleaning the front windscreen and rear window; dilute it min. 50% with water. Only use pure screen washer fluid when strictly necessary due to outside temperature conditions. Do not use chemicals/acids to defrost windows/vehicle glass as they can damage the paint.
- 146) Always use a cleaning agent with a pH value of 4 to 9. Do not use cleaning agents on hot surfaces. Dry the car with a wet chamois leather. Abrasive products and/or polishes should not be used for cleaning the car. Bird droppings must be washed off immediately and thoroughly as the acid they contain is particularly aggressive. Avoid (if at all possible) parking the car under trees; remove vegetable resins immediately as, when dried, it may only be possible to remove them with abrasive products and/or polishes, which is highly inadvisable as they could alter the typical opacity of the paint.
- 147) Do not use a high pressure jet cleaner to clean the motor compartment. The appropriate precautions have been taken to protect all parts and connections, but the pressures generated by these devices are so high that complete protection against water seepages cannot be guaranteed.
- 148) If it is necessary to wash the car from the outside, take care not to insist directly with the water jet onto the charging flap.
- 149) The headlamps have polycarbonate lenses with a protective coating: do not clean them with a dry or abrasive cloth, nor with detergent or solvent products; use a sponge and soapy water or a pH neutral product; when using a highpressure washer on persistent marks, do not keep the lance directed towards the headlamps, lamps or their edges for too long, so as not to damage their protective coating and seals.

## WHEELS AND TYRES
## TYRE CONDITION, WHEEL CONDITION
Drive over edges slowly and at right angles if possible. Driving over sharp edges can cause tyre and wheel damage. Do not trap tyres on the kerb when parking.
Driving with worn or damaged tyres reduces the braking and road holding performance of the vehicle. Regularly check the condition of the tyres (tread and sidewalls) and rims as well as the presence of the valve caps. Seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership in the event of damage or unusual wear.
Always mark the direction of rotation on the tyres that will be stored when fitting winter or summer tyres. Store them in a cool, dry place and away from direct exposure to the sun's rays.
## WINTER TYRES
Winter tyres improve driving safety at temperatures below 7 ° C and should therefore be fitted on all wheels.
In accordance with country-specific regulations, affix the speed sticker in the driver's field of view.
All tyre sizes are permitted as winter tyres.
Winter or 4-seasons tyres can be
identified by the symbol sidewalls.

## TYRE DESIGNATIONS
E.g.
225/55 R 18 98 V
225 : tyre width, mm
- 55 : cross-section ratio (tyre height to tyre width), %
- R : belt type: Radial
- RF : type: RunFlat
- 18 : wheel diameter, inches
- 98 : load index e.g. 98 is equivalent to 750 kg
- V : speed code letter
Speed code letter:
- Q : up to 160 km/h
- S : up to 180 km/h
- T : up to 190 km/h
- H : up to 210 km/h
- V : up to 240 km/h
- W : up to 270 km/h
Choose a tyre appropriate for the maximum speed of your vehicle.
The maximum speed is achievable at kerb weight with driver (75 kg) plus 125 kg payload. Optional equipment could reduce the maximum speed of the vehicle.
## Directional tyres
Directional tyres should be mounted so that they rotate in the correct direction. The proper rotation direction is indicated by a symbol (e.g. an arrow) on the sidewall.
## TYRE PRESSURE
Check the pressure of cold tyres at least every 14 days and before any long journey. Do not forget the spare wheel. This also applies to vehicles with Tyre Underinflation Detection System.
WARNING Under-inflation increases energy consumption. Non-compliant tyre pressures cause tyres to wear prematurely and have an adverse effect on the vehicle's road holding - risk of accident!
JJ000655
319 The tyre pressure information label on the left B-pillar fig. 319 indicates the original equipment tyres and the correspondent tyre pressures.
The tyre pressure data refers to cold tyres. It applies to summer and winter tyres.
If you have driven for more than 10 minutes or more than 6 miles (10 kilometres) at over 31 mph (50 km/h),
247
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
248
add 0.3 bar (30 kPa) to the values indicated on the label.
Always inflate the spare tyre to the pressure specified for full load. Incorrect tyre pressures will impair safety, vehicle handling, comfort and fuel economy and will increase tyre wear. Tyre pressures differ depending on various options. For the correct tyre pressure value, follow the procedure below:
- 1. Identify the engine identifier code.
- 2. Identify the respective tyre.
The tyre pressure tables show all possible tyre combinations. For the tyres approved for your vehicle, refer to the EEC Certificate of Conformity provided with your vehicle or other national registration documents. The driver is responsible for correct adjustment of tyre pressure.
328) 329)
## Temperature dependency
The tyre pressure depends on the temperature of the tyre. During driving, tyre temperature and pressure increase. Tyre pressure values provided on the tyre information label and tyre pressure chart are valid for cold tyres, which means at 20 ° C.
The pressure increases by nearly 10 kPa for a 10 ° C temperature increase. This must be considered when warm tyres are checked.
## TREAD DEPTH
Check tread depth at regular intervals. For safety reasons, it is recommended that the tread depth of the tyres on one axle should not vary by more than 2 mm.
320 JJ000314 The legally permissible minimum tread depth (1.6 mm) has been reached when the tread has worn down as far as one of the tread wear indicators (TWI). Their position is indicated by markings on the sidewall.
If there is more wear at the front than the rear, swap round front wheels and rear wheels periodically. Ensure that the direction of rotation of the wheels remains the same.
Tyres age, even if they are not used. We recommend tyre replacement every 6 years.
## CHANGING TYRE AND WHEEL SIZE
If tyres of a different size than those fitted at the factory are used, it may be necessary to reprogramme the Tyre Underinflation Detection System and make other vehicle modifications. Using different size wheels and tyres from those specified can affect the lifetime of tyres, wheel rotation, ground clearance, the speedometer reading and have an adverse effect on road holding. Fitting different tyres on the front and rear axles can cause the ESC to mistime. Have the label with tyre pressures replaced.
330)
## WHEEL COVERS
Wheel covers and tyres that are factory approved for the respective vehicle and comply with all of the relevant wheel and tyre combination requirements must be used.
If the wheel covers and tyres used are not factory approved, the tyres must not have a rim protection ridge.
Wheel covers must not impair brake cooling.
Spare wheels: Do not use wheel covers.
## TYRE CHAINS
Tyre chains are only permitted on the front wheels.
Only use tyre chains designed to be used with tyre type of the vehicle. For 16 inch and 17 inch tyres (M+S and AllSeasons excluded), only use 120 (9mm) tyre chains.
WARNING The use of tyre chains and the maximum allowed speed is regulated by country-specific legislation.
## 332)
When fitting the tyre chains follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the tyre chains.
After having fitted the tyre chains, stop the vehicle after having driven a short distance and make sure that the tyre chains are correctly tightened.
Jeep has tested and approved the Polaire XP9 tyre chains to increase traction in snowy condition.
WARNING Using non-recommended tyre chains or using tyre chains on other sized tyres can damage the suspensions, body, wheels and/or brakes lines. Damages caused by using nonrecommended tyre chains or incorrectly installing tyre chains, are not covered by the warranty.
## Temporary spare wheel
The use of tyre chains is not permitted on the temporary spare wheel.
## WARNING
327) If winter tyres with a lower speed rating than that indicated in the Registration Document are used, do not exceed the maximum speed corresponding to the speed rating of the tyres used.
328) If the pressure is too low, this can result in considerable tyre warmup and internal damage, leading to tread separation and even to tyre blow-out at high speeds.
329) For specific tyres the recommended tyre pressure as shown in the tyre pressure table may exceed the maximum tyre pressure as indicated on the tyre.
Never exceed the maximum tyre pressure as indicated on the tyre.
330) The use of unsuitable tyres or wheels may lead to accidents and will invalidate the vehicle operating permit.
331) Use of unsuitable tyres or wheel covers could lead to sudden pressure loss and thereby accidents.
332) Damage may lead to tyre blowout.

## "Minimum ground clearance" (reference 1)
The clearance value is measured next to the lower edge of the differential. This value also defines those for the "Approach angle" the "Departure angle" and the "Breakover angle". Dimensions are expressed in mm and refer to the car equipped with its original tyres.
## "Approach angle" (reference 2)
The approach angle is determined by the horizontal line of the road surface and by the tangent line passing between the front wheel and the most projecting low point of the car. The wider the angle, the lower the chance to hit an obstacle with the body or chassis, climbing a steep slope or overcoming an obstacle.
## "Departure angle" (reference 3)
The departure angle is determined by the same lines of the "Approach angle", and refers to the rear part of the car.
## "Breakover angle" (reference 4)
The value of the "Breakover angle" is linked to the ride height of the car and indicates the attitude of the car to overcome a wedge, more or less steep, preventing the car from resting on the ground with the body or chassis after touching the wedge with its lowest and most projecting parts (usually the underbody), because this would highly reduce wheel grip which, lacking adequate grip to the ground would not have sufficient grip to make the car move and slip. The higher the ride height, the wider the breakover angle. Always bear in mind that the higher the ride height, the lower the stability, due to a higher centre of gravity which reduces the side rollover angle.

## WEIGHTS AND LOADS
159) 160)
To identify the weights and loads for your car, refer to the plate shown in fig. 324 and described in the "Vehicle identification number (VIN) plate" chapter or refer to the car registration certificate showing the type-approved weights (for markets, where provided).
- C : maximum authorised weight of car fully laden (GVW).
- D : maximum authorised weight of fully laden car (GVW) plus trailer. If there is no value in the field or if there is a dash, it means that the car cannot tow.
E : maximum permitted weight on first front axle.
F : maximum permitted weight on second rear axle.
To calculate the towable weight with a braked trailer, take the difference between values (D) and (C) shown on the plate.
E.g.: D=2882 kg - C= 1682 kg Braked trailer = 1200 kg + 250 kg SAE towing (*)
WARNING Do not exceed the indicated trailer and towable weights .
WARNING Respect the vehicle towing capacities .
WARNING Never exceed the maximum permitted load indicated on the plate .
(*) SAE towing: taking care never to exceed the maximum permissible load as indicated on the plate (D) for all versions, an increase of up to 250 kg is permitted.
## IMPORTANT
159) Do not load your car any heavier than the gross vehicle weight rating or the front and rear gross axle weight rating. If you do, parts on your car can break, or it can change the way your car handles. This could cause you to lose control. Also overloading can shorten the life of your car. Do not exceed the maximum load for the car and trailer combination. The maximum towable load is only permitted if it does not exceed the maximum load of the combination.
160) When exterior temperatures are high, the vehicle performance may be limited in order to protect the engine. When the exterior temperature is higher than 37 ° C, reduce the towed weight. Towing even with a lightly loaded vehicle can adversely affect its road holding. Braking distances
are increased when towing a trailer. When using a vehicle to tow, never exceed a speed of 100 km/h (62 mph) (observe the local legislation in force).

## FUEL CONSUMPTION AND CO 2 EMISSIONS
The fuel consumption and CO$_{2}$ emission figures declared by the manufacturer are determined on the basis of the type-approval tests laid down by the applicable standards in the country where the vehicle is registered.
Type of route, traffic, weather conditions, driving style, general condition of the vehicle, level of equipment/accessories, use of the climate control system, vehicle load, presence of roof rack, and other situations that negatively affect the aerodynamics or resistance will lead to different consumption values. Only after the first 3,000 km of driving will you establish more even fuel consumption.
To find the specific fuel consumption and CO$_{2}$ emission figures for this car, please refer to the data in the Certificate of Conformity, and the related documentation that accompanies the vehicle.

## PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HANDLING THE CAR AT THE END OF ITS LIFE
(where present)
FCA has been committed for many years to safeguarding the environment through the constant improvement of its production processes and manufacturing products that are increasingly "eco-compatible". To grant customers the best possible service in terms of respecting environmental laws and in response to European Directive 2000/53/EC governing vehicles at the end of their life, FCA is offering its customers the chance to hand over their vehicle at the end of its life without incurring any additional costs. The European Directive sets out that when the vehicle is handed over, the last keeper or owner should not incur any expenses as a result of it having a zero or negative market value.
To hand your vehicle over at the end of its life without extra cost, contact one of our dealerships if you are purchasing another vehicle or an FCA-authorized collection and scrapping center. These centres have been carefully chosen to offer high quality service for the collection, treatment and recycling of vehicles at their end of life, respecting the surrounding environment.
Similarly, to meet its obligations under European Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries, FCA requires you to comply with the national regulations on handling both low-voltage (12 V) and high-voltage lithium ion batteries at all times. This includes consigning vehicles complete with their batteries to one of the collection and demolition centers authorized by FCA to handle such batteries, and not disposing of them improperly, which could lead to personal injuries and/or harm to the environment.
You can find further information on these collection and scrapping centers either from an FCA dealership or by calling the number in the Warranty Booklet or by consulting the websites of the various FCA brands.

## VOICE ASSISTANT (HEY JEEP)
## First steps
(depending on equipment)
The Voice Assistant language is in line with the language chosen and previously configured in the system.
The system supports two languages for cases where the area in which the vehicle is travelling is not covered by the cellular network.
These languages, referred to as on-board languages, are downloaded into the system.
If the chosen language has not been downloaded, a message on the screen appears as soon as the cellular network is not connected for the first time and offers to download it. To use this new language in all areas, download it beforehand (ignition on without starting the engine) via the Wi-Fi network. Apply the download procedure displayed on the screen. Downloading this new language removes the least used on-board language.
## Information - Using the system
When voice commands are activated, say your command after the audible signal.
For commands in several stages, interaction takes place with the system to complete the initial request.
Some commands self-validate after 7 seconds. If the system has not taken your command into account, it will indicate this by a voice message and an on-screen display.
## Opening Voice Assistant
Voice commands can be used on any screen page, provided there are no other sources which take priority in use (reverse, emergency or assistance call, telephone call, other smartphone voice recognition already launched).
The Voice Assistant can be activated by pressing the button located on the
steering wheel or on the touch screen or by saying "Hey Jeep".
NOTE To ensure that voice commands are always recognised by the system, please follow these recommendations: use natural language in a normal tone without breaking up words or raising your voice . After opening the Voice Assistant with the button on the steering wheel or the touch screen button, always wait for the "beep" (sound signal) before speaking. For optimal operation, it is recommended that you close the windows and the sunroof (depending on equipment) to avoid any external interference, and switch the ventilation off. Before speaking the voice commands, ask the other passengers not to speak.
Voice command examples for air conditioning:
- "Raise the fan speed"
- "Turn on air conditioning"
- "I'm too hot"
Voice command examples for radio and media:
- "I want to listen to Michael Jackson"
- "Switch to radio"
- "Tune to 88.5"
NOTE Media voice commands are only available with a USB connection.
Voice command examples for navigation: "Navigate home"

Failure to follow these rules may cause serious accidents and/or death.
## RECORDING EVENT DATA
Electronic control units are installed in your vehicle. These control units process data received from the vehicle's sensors, for example, or data they generate themselves or exchange with each other. Some of these control units are required for the correct operation of your vehicle, some others assist you while driving (driving or manoeuvring aids), while others provide comfort or infotainment functions.
The following contains general information about how data is processed within the vehicle. You will find additional information about the specific data which is downloaded, stored and transmitted to third parties and what it is used for in your vehicle under the keyword "Data protection". This information is directly associated with the references for the functions in question contained in the corresponding vehicle handbook, or in the general terms and conditions of sale.
This information is also available online.
## Vehicle operating data
The control units process the data used for the operation of the vehicle. This data includes, for example: Information about the state of the vehicle (e.g. speed, travel time, lateral acceleration, wheel rotation rate, fastened seat belts display).
Environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, rain sensor, distance sensor).
As a general rule, this data is temporary, is not stored for longer than one operating cycle and is only used within the vehicle itself. The control units often record this data (including the vehicle's key). This function allows either the temporary or permanent storage of information about the state of the vehicle, stresses on components, servicing requirements, as well as events and technical errors.
Depending on the vehicle's equipment level, the data stored is as follows:
Operating state of system components (e.g. filling level, tyre pressures, battery charge status).
- Faults and malfunctions in important system components (e.g. lamps, brakes).
- System reactions in specific driving situations (e.g. deployment of an airbag, triggering of stability control and braking systems).
- Information about events which have damaged the vehicle.
- For electric vehicles, the traction battery charge level and the estimated driving range.
In particular circumstances (e.g. if the vehicle has detected a malfunction), it may be necessary to record data which would otherwise simply not be stored. When taking your vehicle in for servicing (e.g. repairs, maintenance), the stored
operating data may be read along with the vehicle's identification number and used if necessary.
The personnel working for the servicing network (e.g. garages, manufacturers) or third parties (e.g. roadside assistance agents) may read the vehicle's data. This also applies to work carried out under warranty and quality assurance measures.
This data is generally read via the OBD (On-Board Diagnostics) port fitted by law to the vehicle. It is used to report on the technical state of the vehicle or its components and facilitates the diagnosis of malfunctions, in compliance with warranty obligations and for quality improvement. This data, in particular the information relating to stress on components, technical events, operator errors and other malfunctions, is sent to the Manufacturer, if necessary, along with the vehicle's identification number. The Manufacturer's liability may also be engaged. The Manufacturer may also use the operating data taken from the vehicle for product recalls. This data may also be used to check the customer's warranty and any claims made under warranty. Any malfunctions stored in the vehicle may be reset by an after-sales service company during servicing or repair work, or at your request.
## Comfort and infotainment functions
Comfort settings and personalised settings may be saved in the vehicle and modified or reinitialised at any time. Depending on the vehicle's equipment level, this may include:
- Seat position settings.
- Chassis and air conditioning settings.
- Personalised settings such as the interior lighting.
You can enter your own data into the functions of your vehicle's audio and telematic system, as part of the selected functionalities.
Depending on the vehicle's equipment level, this may include:
Multimedia data such as music, videos or photos to be read by an integrated multimedia system.
- Address book data to be used with an integrated hands-free system or with an integrated navigation system.
- Entered destinations.
- Data regarding the use of online services.
This data for the comfort and infotainment functions may be stored locally in the vehicle or saved to a device that you have connected to the vehicle (e.g. smartphone, USB memory stick or MP3 player). Data that you have entered yourself may be deleted at any time. This data may also be transmitted outside the vehicle at your request, particularly when using online services

## Smartphone integration (e.g. Android Auto® or Apple CarPlay)
If your vehicle is equipped accordingly, you can connect your smartphone or another mobile device to the vehicle in order to operate it using the vehicle's integrated controls. Images and sounds from the smartphone can be transmitted through the audio and telematics system. Specific information is simultaneously sent to your smartphone. Depending on the type of integration, this includes data such as location, day/night mode and other general information about the vehicle. For more information, please refer to the user instructions for the vehicle or the audio and telematics system.
Integrating a smartphone allows you to use its applications, such as a navigation app or music player. No other integration between the smartphone and the vehicle is possible, in particular active access to vehicle data. How the data is processed subsequently is determined by the supplier of the application being used. The ability to change settings depends on the application in question and on the operating system installed on your smartphone.
## ONLINE SERVICES
If your vehicle is connected to a wireless network, data can be exchanged between your vehicle and other systems. Connection to a wireless network is made possible via a transmitter located in your vehicle or a mobile device that you have provided (e.g. smartphone). The online services can be used via this wireless connection. These include online services and applications (apps) provided to you by the Manufacturer or other suppliers.
## Exclusive services
As regards the Manufacturer's online services, the corresponding functions are described by the Manufacturer in an appropriate medium (e.g. Owner Manual, Manufacturer's website) and the information about data protection is provided.
Personal data may be used for online services.
The exchange of data for this purpose takes place over a secure connection, using for example the Manufacturer's dedicated computer systems. The collection, processing and use of personal data for the development of services are carried out solely on the basis of a legal authorisation, for example in the case of a legal emergency call system or a contractual agreement or else under a consent agreement.
You can activate or deactivate the services and functions (some may be chargeable) and, in some cases, the vehicle's entire connection to the wireless network. This does not include the statutory functions and services such as the emergency or assistance call system.
## Third-party services
If you use online services provided by other (third-party) suppliers, these services are subject to the responsibility, the data protection and the terms and conditions of use of the supplier in question. The Manufacturer often has no influence over the content exchanged in this regard.
Please therefore ensure that you are aware of the nature, extent and purpose of the collection and use of personal data as part of the thirdparty services provided by the service provider in question.
## SOFTWARE UPDATE
The Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV can download and install selected software updates over a wireless connection.
NOTE The availability of these overthe-air vehicle software updates varies by vehicle and country. Find more information on Jeep website.
## Remote device management and remote software and firmware updates
As an integral part of the service related to the performance of subscribed connected service contracts, necessary device management and necessary software and firmware updates related to the software and firmware for the named connected service will be performed remotely, in particular by using over-theair technology.
For this, a secure radio network connection between the vehicle and the device management server will be established when ignition is switched on and a mobile network is available. Depending on the equipment of the vehicle, connection configuration must be set to "Connected vehicle" to allow the establishment of the radio network connection.
Irrespective of a valid connected service subscription, remote product security or product safety related device management and software and firmware updates will be performed when the processing is necessary for
the compliance with a legal obligation to which the manufacturer is subject (e.g. applicable product liability law, emergency call regulation) or when the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the respective vehicle users and passengers. The establishment of a secure radio network connection and the related remote updates are not affected by privacy settings and will be performed in principal after an initiation by the vehicle user following a respective notification. The system is able to notify receipt of an update as soon as it is connected to an exterior Wi-Fi network or a mobile network. Large updates are downloaded only via the Wi-Fi network.
The availability of an update is notified on the Uconnect™ 10.25"/10.25" NAV screen with an option of immediate installation or postponement of installation.
The installation time is variable and can take several minutes with a maximum of about 30 minutes. A notification will give an estimate of the duration and a description of the update.
Update information is available through the "Settings" application.
Press the "Settings" application. In the list, select the "Updates" tab.
Press the button. It allows you to change the authorisation for automatic downloading of updates via an external Wi-Fi network.
342)
NOTE During the installation process, the vehicle may not be operational.
If the update has failed, seek the assistance of a Jeep Dealership.
NOTE The use of this service is not charged by the Contractor. On the other hand, the use of the WI-FI and/ or cellular networks of your smartphone can generate additional fees if your data plan is exceeded. These possible costs are reflected in the bill of your telephone operator.
## WARNING
342) For safety reasons and because it requires sustained attention by the driver, the installation must be carried out with the ignition on without starting the engine. The installation cannot be carried out in the following cases: engine running, emergency call in progress, insufficient conventional battery level, when charging high-voltage battery (electric vehicles).
